# Knowledge Graph Discovery System Requirements

## Overview
The Knowledge Graph Discovery System is designed to automatically extract structured knowledge from the Verizon website and build a comprehensive knowledge graph that represents entities, relationships, and attributes found in the website content. The system follows ethical web scraping practices while efficiently creating a valuable knowledge resource.

## User Stories

### 1. Ethical Web Scraping
**As a** researcher,  
**I want to** collect data from Verizon's website while respecting their robots.txt rules,  
**So that** I can build a knowledge graph without violating the website's terms or causing unnecessary load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must parse and respect robots.txt rules
- The system must identify allowed and disallowed sections
- The system must use appropriate user agents and request delays
- The system must limit crawling to specific sections of interest

### 2. Efficient Data Collection
**As a** data scientist,  
**I want to** efficiently collect web content from specific sections of Verizon's website,  
**So that** I can focus on the most relevant information for my knowledge graph.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must track visited URLs to avoid duplicate processing
- The system must implement section-based crawling with configurable limits
- The system must be able to handle various content types (HTML, PDF)
- The system must allow configurable crawling depth

### 3. PDF Document Processing
**As a** knowledge engineer,  
**I want to** extract information from PDF documents found on Verizon's website,  
**So that** I can incorporate this valuable content into the knowledge graph.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must identify PDF links on web pages
- The system must download and process PDF documents
- The system must extract text content from PDFs
- The system must integrate PDF content into the knowledge extraction pipeline

### 4. Knowledge Extraction
**As an** AI researcher,  
**I want to** extract structured information (entities, relationships, attributes) from collected web content,  
**So that** I can populate the knowledge graph with accurate information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must identify entities of various types (people, organizations, locations, etc.)
- The system must extract relationships between entities
- The system must detect entity attributes
- The system must represent extracted information as subject-predicate-object triples

### 5. Schema Discovery
**As a** knowledge engineer,  
**I want to** automatically discover a coherent schema from extracted information,  
**So that** the knowledge graph has a consistent structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must identify entity types from extracted information
- The system must identify relationship types
- The system must group similar entities and relationships
- The system must generate a schema that can guide graph construction

### 6. Graph Construction
**As a** data scientist,  
**I want to** build a structured knowledge graph from extracted information,  
**So that** I can analyze relationships and patterns in the data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must create a graph structure with entities as nodes
- The system must represent relationships as edges
- The system must associate properties with nodes and edges
- The system must save the graph in a reusable format

### 7. Graph Visualization
**As an** analyst,  
**I want to** visualize the knowledge graph,  
**So that** I can intuitively understand the relationships and structure of the information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must generate visual representations of the graph
- The system must use different colors or shapes for different node types
- The system must generate readable visualizations even for large graphs
- The system must save visualizations in standard image formats

### 8. Neo4j Integration
**As a** database engineer,  
**I want to** import the knowledge graph into Neo4j,  
**So that** I can perform complex graph queries and analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must convert the graph to Neo4j's data model
- The system must establish connection to Neo4j
- The system must import nodes and relationships
- The system must verify the imported data

### 9. Graph Enrichment
**As a** knowledge engineer,  
**I want to** enrich the knowledge graph with additional information and inferences,  
**So that** the graph is more comprehensive and valuable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must infer new relationships based on existing ones
- The system must enhance entity attributes where possible
- The system must integrate domain knowledge into the graph
- The system must measure the impact of enrichment

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- The system should be able to process at least 100 web pages within 30 minutes
- Knowledge extraction should take less than 5 seconds per page on average

### 2. Reliability
- The system must handle network errors gracefully
- The system must save progress periodically to allow resuming interrupted crawls

### 3. Maintainability
- The system must use a modular design with well-defined components
- The system must include appropriate logging and error handling
- The system must be well-documented

### 4. Scalability
- The system should be able to handle websites with thousands of pages
- The system should be able to build knowledge graphs with millions of nodes

### 5. Usability
- The system should provide clear progress indicators
- The system should generate meaningful reports of the discovery process
