# Knowledge Graph Discovery System Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The Knowledge Graph Discovery System aims to automatically extract structured knowledge from the Verizon website and build a comprehensive knowledge graph. The system follows ethical web scraping practices while efficiently creating a valuable knowledge resource that represents entities, relationships, and attributes found in the website content.

   - Implemented the URLHistoryTracker for maintaining URL history
   - Implemented the PDFExtractor for handling PDF documents
   - Implemented the EnhancedDataIngestionAgent with section-based crawling

3. **Knowledge Extraction Layer**
   - Implemented the InformationExtractionAgent for entity and relationship extraction
   - Integrated with spaCy for NLP tasks

4. **Schema Discovery**
   - Implemented the SchemaDiscoveryAgent for discovering entity and relationship types
   - Created methods for schema generation based on extracted information

5. **Graph Construction**
   - Implemented the GraphConstructionAgent for building the knowledge graph
   - Implemented the NetworkXHandler for graph operations
   - Added methods for graph statistics and visualization

6. **Neo4j Integration**
   - Implemented the Neo4jHandler for Neo4j integration
   - Added methods for importing NetworkX graphs into Neo4j
   - Created example Cypher queries for graph exploration

7. **Graph Enrichment**
   - Implemented the GraphEnrichmentAgent for enhancing the knowledge graph
   - Added methods for inferring additional relationships

8. **Jupyter Notebook Demo**
   - Created a comprehensive demo notebook that showcases the entire knowledge graph discovery process
   - Implemented code for each step with appropriate explanations
