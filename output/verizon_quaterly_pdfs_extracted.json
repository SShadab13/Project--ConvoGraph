We  believe  that  Consolidated  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Consolidated  Adjusted  EBITDA  Margin  and  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company's operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences  in  capital  structure,  taxes  and  depreciation  and  amortization  policies.  Further,  the  exclusion  of  non-operational  items  and  special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon  Business  Group  (\"Verizon  Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation  costs  and  non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain  businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued  transformation  initiatives. Asset  rationalization  recorded  during  the  second  quarter  of  2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  primarily  relates  to  Verizon  Business  network  assets  that  we  made  a  decision  to  cease  use  of  as  part  of  our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain  administrative  fees.  Business  transformation  costs  recorded  during  2023  primarily  relate  to  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  strategic  partnership initiatives  in  our  managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated operating revenues.  \nWe have not provided a reconciliation  for  our  Consolidated Adjusted  EBITDA  Growth  Forecast  because  we  cannot,  without  unreasonable  effort,  predict  the special items that could arise during 2025."

While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our  newly  acquired  and  long-held  businesses,  and  with  both  acquisitive  and  non-acquisitive  peer  companies.  We  believe  that  it  is  important  for  investors  to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets.  \nWe have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025."

We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.  \nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities.

We believe that  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA,  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company's operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences  in capital  structure,  taxes  and depreciation and amortization policies.  Further,  the exclusion of  non-operational  items  and special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is  calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon Business  Group (\"Verizon Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation costs  and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued transformation initiatives. Asset  rationalization recorded during the second quarter  of  2023 relates to certain real  estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of  as  part  of  our  transformation initiatives. Asset  rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter  of  2023 primarily  relates  to Verizon Business  network  assets  that  we made a decision to cease use of  as  part  of  our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business  transformation costs  recorded during 2023 primarily  relate to costs  incurred in connection with strategic  partnership initiatives  in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of  our BlueJeans business offering in 2023.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated operating revenues.  \nWe have not  provided a reconciliation for  our  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast  because we cannot,  without  unreasonable effort,  predict  the special items that could arise during 2025."

Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months.

While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our  newly  acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that  it  is  important  for  investors  to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets.  \nWe have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025."

We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or  expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it  is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.  \nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities."

                "content": "Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by addressing the evolving policy and macroeconomic landscape. We continue to monitor the ongoing developments, and we're confident in our ability to effectively manage our business for our customers and shareholders.  \nIn periods of heightened uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength, given the importance and the essential nature of our connectivity services, the size and quality of our customer base, and the strength of our balance sheet.  \nOur diverse portfolio of offerings serves all market segments and positions us for success in any economic environment. And with our bias for action and position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment but thrive in it.  \nNow let me turn to our results. We had an exceptional financial start of the year delivering strong growth across our key financial metrics. Wireless service revenue was up 2.7% at the high end of our guided range. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion was our highest reported result ever, growing 4% and exceeding our guided range.  \nFree cash flow was up over $900 million and enabled continued execution of our capital allocation priorities. Even with the recent declines in consumer confidence, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance.  \nOur comprehensive portfolio of offerings and strategic moves we have made over the last year position as well for sustainable financial and subscriber growth while also improving the customer experience.  \nThese moves include our brand refresh along with continuous evolution of customer first offerings such as myPlan, myHome, and My Biz Plan, organic and inorganic broadband expansion with the pending acquisition of Frontier, AI Connect and satellite partnerships that enables texting anywhere for free.  \nRootMetrics recently recognized Verizon as the best, fastest and most reliable 5G network in the US, and our network continues to get even better. On mobility, we're on track to deploy C-band to 80% to 90% of our planned sites by year end, and we are aggressively rolling out 5G advanced features.  \nOn Fios expansion, we're ahead of our plan year-to-date to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year. On fixed wireless access, our multi-dwelling unit solution is expected to gradually ramp over time along with continued expansion of homes and businesses covered with ongoing C-band deployment.  \nTurning to our operation performance, our segmentation strategy focused on delivering targeted offerings is yielding positive results. We delivered a year-on-year improvement in combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds. We did have a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn due to recent price ups and pressure from federal government accounts.  \nHowever, our prepaid nets adds of 137,000 were the best since the TracFone acquisition. In broadband, we continue to take share. With fixed wireless access and fiber, we have the most complete offering covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over the time.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

                "content": "Thanks, Hans. Good morning, everyone. As we reported earlier, the first quarter demonstrated our ability to drive strong financial growth with wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of our guided range. Additionally, we had our best ever reported adjusted EBITDA result at $12.6 billion and we delivered an over $900 million improvement in free cash flow from the prior year.  \nWe improved our total combined postpaid and core prepaid phone net adds year over year. We're taking share on broadband, and we continue to innovate with myPlan, myHome and our new My Biz Plan to deliver best-in-class value across all of our customers.  \nOur consumer postpaid phone net losses of [356,000] reflect the impact of recent pricing actions. We exited the first quarter with positive momentum. Consumer Postpaid phone gross ads in March were up mid single-digits from the prior year, and the performance in April continues to be strong.  \nAdditionally, our new three-year price lock and free phone guarantee is resonating in the market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds year over year for the full year. Business phone net adds were 67,000 in the period, impacted by pressure within federal government accounts.  \nWe continue to work with customers of all sizes to deliver connectivity solutions that match their needs. Our momentum continued to build in core prepaid where we delivered 137,000 net adds. Our strong execution and investment in Visible, Total Wireless and Straight Talk is paying off, and we continue to expect positive service revenue contribution from core prepaid in the second half of the year.  \nIn broadband, our Fios and fixed wireless access offerings are attracting new customers quarter after quarter. We had 339,000 net adds in the period and we continue to take market share. This is a solid start to the year and one we expect to build on as we expand our C-band and Fios availability.  \nShifting to financials. We delivered strong results with 2.7% wireless service revenue growth. This reflects the benefits of pricing actions, expansion of fixed wireless access subscribers and continued adoption of perks and premium plans.  \nAdjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion grew 4% in the quarter, which represents our best quarter of year-over-year growth in nearly four years and demonstrates our sustained and disciplined approach to growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.19 for the quarter, up 3.5% year over year. Finally, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion positions us to continue to pay down debt in alignment with our capital allocation priorities and ahead of the anticipated close of the Frontier transaction.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

It all starts with how we compete and go to market. Our network is the foundation of everything we offer. We have the best and most reliable network, and we continue to extend our network leadership with our ongoing C-band deployment and broadband expansion with fixed wireless access and fiber, including the pending acquisition of Frontier.  \nOur customer-first connectivity offerings deliver unmatched control, value and simplicity for all our customer segments. Over the last two years, we have introduced targeted offers for all customer segments across mobility and broadband. As the market leader, we remain committed to introducing new and innovative offerings that meet the evolving needs of our customers.  \nNext is the value-added services, which is one of our key differentiators in the market. We offer add-on perks including exclusive discounts on some of the top streaming services such as Netflix and Max. Given the size and the quality of our base and the scale of our distribution network, we offer rates that customers cannot find anywhere else, and we will continue to expand our perk portfolio.  \nOver the past few years, we have dedicated substantial resources and capital to enhance our customer experience through various initiatives including AI for customer care and personalization. Although the industry, including Verizon still has room to improve, we have made great progress towards our goal of seamless customer interactions.  \nLastly, our brand is a pivotal element in our go-to-market strategy. Recognizing its importance, we made a strategic decision to refresh our brand last year, and we are committed to further developing and strengthening our brand to drive continued growth and customer engagement.  \nBy focusing on these key pillars of our value proposition, we attract new customers, foster loyalty among existing ones and maximize the long-term value of each customer relationship. This holistic approach ensures that we remain competitive in the marketplace and drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth.  \nNow, let me turn to Sampath, who will provide more details on our consumer transformation journey."

Beginning in 2023, we revamped our sales engine, moving to a regional model, individual sales incentives and a stronger focus on local marketing. We also launched myPlan, giving customers more control, value and simplicity.  \nThis allowed us to significantly reduce our perceived price premium while driving higher average revenue per user through perks, insurance and financial services. In 2024, we relaunched our brand and accelerated myPlan and myHome adoption.

                "content": "This transaction will help enable our long-term goal of offering broadband to over 100 million premises, including fiber passings of 35 million to 40 million. We also turned around our prepaid business, which includes the industry's largest portfolio of brands. This was driven by a revamp of our value propositions, expanded exclusive and third-party distribution, and instilling the same operational rigor we introduced in our postpaid business.  \nThe core prepaid brands returned to subscriber growth in 2024 and achieved their best results since the TracFone acquisition this quarter. This demonstrates our ability to win across all market segments. Customers are responding to our offers and we anticipate gaining market share in prepaid this year.  \nAs we enter year three, we are doubling down on our customer-first strategy with an increased focus on customer retention with the Verizon value guarantee, and industry leading 3-year price lock, free phone guarantee for everyone and savings you cannot get elsewhere.  \nBefore  I  dive  into  the  Verizon  value  guarantee,  let  us  quickly  recap  what  makes  our  offering  stand  out  from  the  competition.  Our  strategic differentiation centers on creating real customer value through a unique combination of network superiority and customer first offerings. Our myPlan and myHome offerings have been the key drivers of our transformation.  \nThese offerings go beyond basic connectivity to include premium entertainment and adjacent services that deliver significant savings for the customer. Today, you can get8 of the most popular streaming services from Verizon for $50. That is value customers can only get at Verizon.  \nOur portfolio of adjacent services include industry leading insurance products for both mobility and the connected home and give customers even more peace of mind. We offer even more ways to save through our financial service partners and products, including the Verizon Visa card and the Openbank high yield savings account with Santander, both exclusive to Verizon customers. This business is growing at a double-digit rate and bringing in margin rich service revenue.  \nFinally, we launched Verizon Access loyalty program, giving customers access to events like the exclusive pre-sale of 100,000 Beyonce concert tickets, NFL, NBA and NHL games, and lifetime experiences such as the 140,000 free tickets we gave out to the first Verizon Super Bowl fanfest parties.  \nThere is no other plan in the industry like myPlan in myHome, and the beauty of having them built side by side is our ability to offer seamless account linkage and promote joint offers. For converged customers, our retention rates are significantly better than those with just mobility or broadband validating our convergence strategy.  \nSimply put, we offer the most differentiated value proposition in the industry and with our recently launched offers for both new and existing customers, we are delivering what people want and need on their terms.  \nSo now let's turn to what we announced a few weeks ago. We launched a game-changing offer, a 3-year price lock and a free phone guarantee with trade in for new and existing customers. This offer was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and is a key component of our strategy to deliver sustainable growth.  \nThe premise of this offer began several quarters ago as emerging consumer trends showed a growing desire for predictability, price control and value. All things that are particularly relevant in today's economic environment. Customers want peace of mind, and we are giving them just that.  \nThe key elements of this offer include a 3-year price lock guarantee that covers the network portion of all tiers of myPlan and myHome, and current customers were automatically enrolled on day one. Guaranteed trade in credit for phones to new and existing customers within their plan tiers, free satellite text messaging on all plans. Customers should not have to pay for texting, and it's part of the value we provide to our customers.  \nCustomers love our perks and the massive savings they deliver. We had over 10 million perk subscriptions at the end of the first quarter. We now anticipate 15 million subscriptions on our platform by the end of this year, an increase of 1 million perks from our prior forecast in the year-end 2025.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \nThey love getting more value for their money with Verizon Visa card and Openbank high-yield savings account. And customers with both mobile and home services get a free monthly perk that will drive customer loyalty. We did not just launch an offer, we set a new standard for customer value, and customers are responding very well.  \nEarly indicators in April suggest strong gross add momentum and very good reception from customers, including many new customers attracted to Verizon. We expect the Verizon value guarantee to provide many benefits to Verizon.  \nFirst, growth. We will continue to drive revenue through higher volumes, higher premium mix, perk adoption and upgrading customers to myPlan. All of that is in addition to revenue benefits from a growing FWA base along with the wholesale business and the momentum with prepaid, which we expect to turn service revenue positive in the second half of the year.  \nSecond, better customer retention. In the past, we've made necessary price adjustments, which impacted churn, but we expect trends to improve through the year, and this launch puts us on a path to get back to the lowest churn in the industry over time.  \nAnd third, we have constructed this offer in a flexible manner to give us continued financial discipline. The price lock applies to myPlan and myHome network plans only. It doesn't apply to perks, discounts, taxes or fees, and we can still adjust price on legacy plans or introduce new plans if we see an opportunity in the market. Another important note is that the free phone offer will be tiered by plan and require a device trade-in.  \nOverall, we believe this is just the beginning of how we'll earn lasting customer loyalty and continue to grow the Verizon base, including deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds in 2025 compared to 2024. We are back to leading the market, not reacting to it, and we are the only carrier with the brand portfolio covering every price point, positioning us for further growth across every segment of the market.  \nThe 3-year price lock guarantee is the next phase in our consumer transformation, giving consumers the best network, value and 24/7 support with myPlan and myHome, plus additional peace of mind with the free phone and satellite texting. We want to be people's first choice, providing products, services and experience they can't get elsewhere.  \nWith that, let me turn back to Hans.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nThank you, Sampath. In summary, we are on plan with our multi-year consumer transformation. We're offering the most differentiated value proposition, and we are well positioned to drive subscriber and financial growth.  \nI'm incredibly proud of the team's dedication and efforts transforming the business. I'm confident that the actions we are taking will set the business up for sustainable long-term growth and extend our industry leadership.  \nNow, Brady, we are ready for questions.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question."

Any additional color you can give us on how tariffs on, I guess, first handsets and then telecom equipment could affect the business?  \nOn the handset side, you expect the promotions to scale with tariffs and what do you expect the impact to be on upgrades? And then on the equipment side, is tariffs on equipment coming into the US mean the budget stays the same and maybe you do less homes passed? Or just how that unfolds?  \nAnd then secondly, for Sampath, thanks for all the color on the consumers and the strategy. And thanks for the color on the gross adds leaving the quarter. Can we talk a little bit about churn? I mean, is all the new plans and promotions and offers you have in place, does that help churn in the second quarter? Or do we have to wait until the second half of the year?  \nAnd that comment on getting back to industry-leading churn, is that something you expect to achieve by the fourth quarter, by the end of this year, or just more color on how that plays out would be great?

                "content": "Thank you, John. Let me talk about the tariffs. Of course, tariffs is a little bit of a moving target where they are. But if we take our capital expenditures, it's a very small portion of the [$18 billion], which is the midpoint of the guide this year that it is exposed to tariffs. And on top of that, we are working with all our suppliers, as we have done so.  \nI mean, during COVID-19, we had no impact at all with the supply chain issues there were because I think my team is the best in the industry to handle that. So that will not change any type of investments we're doing in CapEx or anything. We cannot foresee that.  \nWhen it comes to handsets, that's also, of course, very early to say where the tariff is going to go and what's going to happen. But in general, if the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we are not planning to cover that in our work.  \nThat's just not going to be possible. So we will continue to be with financial discipline in whatever promotions we have, but we will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handset. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market. But again, it's too early to say. We don't know where tariff is going to go.  \nBut I think my team is well prepared for handling all of it. And on the consumer side, I think Sampath has talked quite a lot about it. I think that the team has done a tremendous work with doing all the new proposals and the new promotions we had all the way from myPlan and myHome home and all of that.  \nAnd now we come to the third leg with the price lock and the phone guarantee. I think we're right in the moment, and we're leading from a very strong financial position. But I'll let Sampath talk a little bit more about the churn and where we are there."

It helped us lock our revenue for the rest of the year and it was the right thing to do. Look, in Q1, the cohorts that were priced up had higher elasticity than anticipated. And the higher churn can be largely attributed and isolated to those cohorts.  \nSo because of that, we think churn is transitory, it is abating, and we expect to get back to BAU by the second half of the year. And we've got other levers that we are deploying quite aggressively. The first and the biggest one is Verizon value guarantee. The 3-year price lock and the free phone base is resonating really well, both for our base and for new customers as well.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

We have a lot of AI-driven customer experiences, updates in the funnel in the second quarter and the rest of the year.

I think our propositions that we have had in the market that's really resonating with our customers, both on the business side and on the consumers and then adding also both the wireless business and the broadband business.  \nI mean, the broadband business continued to gain share in this quarter. We have done -- that's why I'm not sure how many quarters right now as well as now we turned around the prepaid business as well, which I'm very proud of what the team has done. So I think we're competing well. But of course, it's going to be competitive.  \nIt's a great product and it's a great market, but there's nothing new when it comes to that. I would ask Sampath to comment on the momentum that we have gained in March and April. But on the finance before I move it over to Tony, yeah, what you saw in this quarter is that how hard we worked with efficiency because we have leverage right now.

As we came into April, we launched the Verizon value guarantee, and we are seeing double-digit growth in gross adds. I think that's largely because how well the offer is resonating both for base as well as new customers coming into the category.  \nSo we have good momentum coming out of March and currently in April right now. And this gives us comfort that in 2025, we'll have better for net adds than in 2024. Because on the back half of the year, we see churn coming back to a BAU posture and continued momentum on gross adds, the combination of those two is what gives us comfort that will have a good result for net adds in 2025."

So on the EBITDA in your question, look, we're off to a great start, and we're very confident in the EBITDA guide and it starts with the strong service revenue growth that Hans mentioned at 2.7%, and very healthy customer economics when you look at that versus the promo amortization as well.  \nAnd as Hans mentioned, we continue to focus on the cost transformation work and we always working to make the business more efficient, whether it's the customer care, managed services work that Kyle and Sampath are doing day in and day out or the network decommissioning as well.  \nAnd we also completed our voluntary separation program, and we expect to see a full run rate benefit of that for the balance of the year. And we've said many times, volumes are important, but we're going to drive volumes and be very disciplined in support of our service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, and that has not changed at all.  \nOn your question on business margins, look, Hans mentioned this earlier, the team is doing a great job in growing the wireless portfolio. If you think about the mix of business shifting more wireless now, Kyle and the team have been growing both mobility and FWA for many quarters now.  \nSo that mix shift is skewing more wireless. And as that skews more wireless, that brings more margin with it. And we're also seeing some early contribution from private 5G networks and also AI Connect, where we saw improvements in the fourth quarter.  \nAnd then on the cost side, the team continues to take cost out, being very disciplined at the deal desk, particularly on business wireless and also the work we're doing around HCL with managed services and also the network decoms as well. So we're pleased to the start to the year. Obviously, the goal here is to grow the business margins for the full year, and we're off to a great start.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nYeah. Thanks, Ben. Brad, ready for the next question.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

Maybe first off, on the consumer side, maybe Sampath or Hans, you could talk to the broad behavior you're seeing from consumers from March into April. Are you seeing any kind of significant change in consumer behavior, trade downs, more reticence to upgrade phones?  \nOr actually are you seeing potentially consumers react to the potential for tariffs and actually pulling forward some upgrades into the month of April. I mean, maybe how are you thinking about that, the impact of the sort of knock-on impact of tariffs on consumer behavior. Anything you're seeing in terms of the deterioration of consumer in terms of health, credit metrics or whatnot?  \nAnd then maybe as a second question, can you maybe just sort of talk about following on the business EBITDA question. I mean, that really sticks out to me as the best growth you've seen in quite some time. Can you maybe talk about the cost metrics underlying that? Are those structural in nature due to the HCL arrangement? Or are there any onetime effects that we should think about? And do you think business EBITDA growth is sustainable from here? Thank you."

When it comes to consumer behavior, I mean, in general, we haven't seen any major consumer shifts in behavior, even though we read the same articles that everybody else that consumer sentiment come back or coming down. Of course, we have a product, the mobility and broadband. It's so essential for our consumers and for our business customers because it's just relevant. So we haven't seen that.  \nAnd Tony can talk a little about the payments as well, but they are continue very intact, no deterioration on payments. And then there have been speculation also of any growth in handsets due to worries for tariffs. I think what we can see, and I think Sampath can talk about it is that we have seen a somewhat uptick.  \nBut I think it comes more from our offering that we start with a new 3-year price lock-in as well as that we had any phone guarantee trade-in. I think that has driven a little bit more handsets for us, not per se. But maybe Sampath and Tony will talk a little bit, and Tony will talk about the margin as well. So let's start with Sampath about the momentum there.  \nSowmyanarayan Sampath - Verizon Communications Inc - Executive Vice President and CEO of Verizon Consumer Group  \nLook, we have good momentum in our business that March and April were very strong, and April have double-digit growth there. We're seeing good premium mix, in other words, a portion of our base new customers that is taking our premium plans. That mix has actually grown higher.  \nSo that suggests that a value prop is resonating well and customers like what we offer. In terms of upgrades, look, Q1 was a bit soft, and we didn't chase volumes where there was no demand, we didn't think it made sense for us to chase volumes there.  \nFor the whole year, I think we're still committing to a mid single-digit growth in overall upgrade. There will be some volatility quarter-to-quarter as that works through. As we come into April, there will be some pent-up demand mostly from the Verizon value guarantee. Customers really like that. So they're going to take advantage of that. But overall, for the year, we still think mid single-digit growth for upgrade holds. Tony?"

So on the customer payment trends, look, Hans said this in the prepared remarks. The business is very resilient, and the demand and priority for connectivity is still high, and the payment trends we see are still very stable in both consumer and business and very much at normal historical levels.  \nThe agings and the quality of the receivables continue to be very strong. And the bad debt we see -- and as you know, we have a very high-quality customer base. And the bad debt that we do see trends with volume growth, and you see the gross add growth. But as always, we're going to continue to monitor the trends very closely, but no change in trends there.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nAnd then on the Verizon Business Group's performance, I think that they are now into year-over-year improvements and the focus for Kyle and the team together with Tony is to continue to drive year-over-year improvements. That can be a little bit up and down.  \nBut definitely, the focus and the target is clear for us, continue to grow our Verizon Business bottom line.

We play through our partners, but directly, we do not play in the space there. So that segment could have some impact, but very little impact to Verizon. The second is on the prepaid side, immigration could impact the lower end of prepaid. That's also not a segment where Verizon has a high level of participation in that segment.  \nAnd on prepaid, despite lower immigration last three quarters, we're actually seeing our best performance in a very long time. We are gaining on the higher end of prepaid, which is why we are seeing strong performance despite low immigration in those segments."

And remember, our priority is mobility first when we roll out C-band.  \nSo that means that the potential open for sale is a little bit smaller. And we said that's going to happen in the first half of the year. What we're doing to add to that is, of course, number one, the MDU solution that we now have launched in more than 15 markets will start ramping during the year, and that will help us to have more. And then, of course, we're going to bring out the C-band more widely.  \nOur plan is to go to 80% to 90% this year. So that's going to increase. And then we have our Fios, which last year was roughly 450,000 OFS, we're ramping up to 650,000. That will help us to continue.

So what I will talk about more is wireless service revenue and how we think about it in the medium term. As far as the Verizon value guarantee, it was contemplated in our '25 guidance. But let me talk about some of the puts and takes that we have in our wireless revenue.  \nThe first is higher volumes. We'll have higher volumes in '25 compared to '24, and that will help with wireless service revenue. Second is only 50% of our base is on myPlan with the Verizon value guarantee, there are more incentives for customers to migrate to my plan, which tends to be accreted to revenue immediately.  \nLonger term, look, we have step-ups. There's a lot of value in our ultimate high-end plan, including an upgrade to unlimited hotspot, which we did last week, and it's really helping with the premium mix. Perks is another area that we'll continue to grow. We had said that we'll get to 14 million perks by the end of this year. I'm happy to say that I think we have line of sight to 15 million perks, an increase of 1 million perks by the time the year ends.  \nFWA, look, that's a place for good, strong service revenue growth, both on volume, but also on ARPU with a much higher premium mix that we had planned. Value on our prepaid business, historically, has been a drag on our service revenue.  \nIn 2024, it was a 0.8% drag on our overall service revenue. We expect that to turn positive in the second half as volumes grow nicely, and that will help with the long-term service revenue growth. The last is our wholesale business. It has healthy service revenue growth margin in it. So those are all the different levers that we have at our disposal to drive long-term wireless service revenue growth, and we are very comfortable with sustained growth in our business.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nThanks, Peter.

Obviously, EBITDA, there is SG&amp;A side in consumer was -- I wouldn't necessarily say depressed, but was there any perhaps savings or a pullback in spend related to SG&amp;A that will resurface or be a bit more aggressive in 2Q and beyond as we think about the price guarantee and getting some, I guess, advertising and sales and marketing push behind that? So that's a quick just housekeeping question.  \nAnd then as you're thinking about the company's broader multiyear convergence strategy, obviously, there is some fiber available in the market as well as others looking for potential partners. But if you step back, how do you think about perhaps -- or does it make sense to either partner with additional fiber providers to accelerate the fiber-to-the-home or your fiber locations push? Or does it perhaps make sense to accelerate your fiber footprint build engine somewhat at the expense of leverage and free cash flow in the interim ahead of the Frontier deal close? Thank you."

And our focus right now is, of course, to close Frontier.  \nAnd when we have Frontier closed, we have said initially as we didn't have all the data, that plus 1 million OFS a year should be what we're targeting and plus means plus. We haven't defined in that we need to get closer to the closing to give you an update, and we will do that.  \nSo we are very focused on that and see that we're doing the right thing. And then on convergence, the only thing I would say, first of all, I think we have owner economics on everything in broadband and mobility, which means that we have a great position on convergence. And a big portion, I would say, the majority and maybe Sampath can comment on it.  \nIf you take the majority of all the customers coming in on broadband this quarter, they're [mostly] (corrected by company after the call) converged. So it's actually working for us. So maybe Sampath, you can comment on that first, and then we'll go to Tony on the EBITDA."

And that helps with long-term churn, but also proves the Verizon model of convergence, which tends to be very demand-led, it's based on a strong offering and giving customers what they want, which is flexibility, not just using price and promotions to get a converged offering."

So would it take to get an update in terms of your spectrum position and how you guys are thinking about some of the bands coming up in this year and beyond? Thank you."

And I hope that you're not using a Verizon line because it was a little bit wobbly. Anyhow, I think I heard your question. And the first one was around the long-term plan of 35 million to 40 million fiber coverings. Yeah. That's the long-term plan we have. And again, we did that communication when we just had made the offer to acquire Frontier.  \nWe are, of course, in the planning stage right now and of course, working through the regulatory approvals. As soon as we get more clarity and closer to the closing of Frontier, we will do more updates where we are and timing, et cetera. And secondly, I would say, everything with the Frontier transaction is going as planned. Our plan is to close it in the first quarter.  \nSo that is going according to plan, but we are in the planning stage right now as we have not that acquired entity in our hands. But as soon as we are closing in on that, we will have more updates where we are. But that was a long-term number we gave when we made the acquisition.  \nWhen it comes to spectrum, I think, first of all, we have a really good position on spectrum. I think the C-band and the millimeter wave positions that we have is really yielding. And we have talked about it on previous calls that when we deploy C-band, we have lower churn, better step-ups.  \nWe are creating fixed wireless access opportunities. So it is really making a difference for us. So the second-hand market or spectrum is always coming in and out. We always do an evaluation if it makes sense for us to buy it. It's a buy versus build, but I don't see any major second-hand market spectrum coming up.  \nI think it's more important long term for the US government for the competitiveness of the US to actually bringing out spectrum over time in order for the carriers to continue to grow. And I think that we all are aligned at that in the industry, it's going to be important.  \nBut that's not a short-term issue, not even medium for us. But over long term, US need to come up with spectrum to continue to compete, especially with 5G advanced and 6G coming later on.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nBrad, ready for the next question."

So that's why I'm talking about that.  \nThen what I said on handsets, it still remains. If we're going to see those type of increases on handsets that we've heard, we are not planning to absorb those. I mean that needs to be passed on to the customers. That's the only way to do it because that's so much money. And then on the broadband, we continue to see very good performance on broadband. The Fios, I think is just doing great, the churn is extremely low.  \nOn the fixed wireless access, we have good gross adds it's a very attractive product from (inaudible) and then what we see is, of course, our churn that it is higher than on Fios because it's a -- product is in early stages compared to Fios that has been around for 25 years or at least 20-plus -- 22, Tony tells me.

But what's interesting for us is because of our segmentation approach on FWA and Fios, where on FWA, we lead with value for money, we lead with convenience. And on Fios, we lead with just incredible reliability and performance.  \nThat segmentation strategy is working well, and we are growing on both sides. That's why we had a very strong quarter at 339,000 broadband net adds for both consumer and business.  \nOn churn, Fios had its best churn in a very, very long time this quarter and it goes back to the strong NPS customer satisfaction and reliability of the fiber plant. On FWA, we are seeing sequential improvement in churn, which is really important for us as the product matures, and we get more comfortable, and customers get more comfortable with the piece.  \nIn terms of ARPU, we are seeing good ARPU growth across both Fios and our FWA products. Two things are happening. One is we're getting better price realization. Two is a better premium mix in terms of higher-end plans on FWA and 1 gig-plus plant on Fios. A combination of those two is giving us good ARPU growth in the pace.  \nSo overall, it's a really good market for us. We are doing extremely well. We are taking share every single quarter in the market. We are growing on volume and we are growing on price. And that's the perfect thing to build a long-term sustainable business in the broadband space.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nBrad, we have time for one last question, please."

I was wondering if you could talk about the breadth of that launch, maybe comment on what some of the markets are that you've launched in, how available the product is in those markets? Any comment on homes available?  \nAnd then also, how is the product performing? What kinds of speeds and reliability you're seeing? And then lastly, can you talk about what's involved in expanding that services availability from here? What are the sort of gating factors to doing that? Thank you.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nOn the first question about the momentum we are seeing in March and April, and I think what we see that's because of our offerings. I mean, I don't see anything else if the industry is coming back or not. I think this is related to us how we perform.  \nAnd remember, this is a plan that Sampath and his team together with our CMO has had for a long time to take the next step with our offering, and it resonates with our customers because, I mean, whatever we have learned from our customer is that they want the control or predictability about the offerings, they want the simplicity of the offers and they want the value and we're hitting on all three of them.  \nSo I think that maybe Sampath can comment after this, but I can talk about the MDU. Yeah, we have launched the MDU solution in more than 15 markets. And of course, in the beginning, you start with certain high rises.  \nAnd this is, of course, a Fios work. You need to see that the landlords in every house is accepting our solution and then you can sell it into the whole household. So of course, we are working in parallel with a technical solution as well as seeing that we are opening up more and more MDUs. And that is going to roll out over the year.  \nAnd it's both for the business side, but I would say, mainly by the consumer side, this is opening up. We have different type of solutions on technology, both on Fios like performance down to fixed wireless access performance. And that's how we're going to work it because ultimately, we want to give choice for our customers for different type of speed tiers as we did the fixed wireless access, et cetera.  \nSo this is going to ramp over the year, and we just came out. So we feel good about the solution and the technology, and this is just adding opportunity for us to grow our broadband. But maybe, Sampath, you can add something."

Our sales team is doing an incredible job of explaining it to customers.  \nAnd then lastly, is impact on the base because to get the Verizon value guarantee, the base has to do absolutely nothing. They all get locked in for three years with a price guarantee. And they like that and hence, it's driving add aligned opportunity for us as well in the space.  \nWhat we are seeing is good performance on a prepaid side of our business. That's a base that's been incredibly strong in the first quarter. We're likely taking share in prepaid. And we're seeing good performance across all our core brands. Total, Visible and Straight Talk are probably the brands that had the strongest performance.  \nAnd it's the same playbook that we had in postpaid.

And I would say this is Verizon at its best in execution. Taking it from where it was, the whole team with Sampath has turned this around with branding, segmenting the market. And basically, all our brands are growing at the moment in prepaid.  \nAnd I think that we're going to see that going forward. I'm really excited, and this was the right decision for Verizon to buy TracFone and we can be in all segments of the market with wireless, and that's where we should be as a leader and number one in this market.

I'm Brady Connor, and on this recording you'll hear from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas.  \nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found at the start of the earnings presentation posted on our Investor Relations website.  \nInformation in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website.  \nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  \nDiscussions and comments related to our 2025 guidance exclude any assumptions regarding the potential effects of the tariff environment, owing to the uncertain and evolving nature of these impacts.  \nMaterials related to this discussion were posted this morning to our Investor Relations website. Additionally, we hope you'll join the webcast of our discussion of the earnings results and business updates that starts at 8:30am Eastern time today, April 22nd.  \nWith that, I'll turn it over to Hans.  \nHans Vestberg Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nWe had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter with continued execution of our longterm strategy. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our business and our strategic advantage as a full-service connectivity provider, driving financial growth despite changing market conditions.  \nWe delivered strong financial growth across all our key financial metrics in the first quarter.  \nWireless Service Revenue of 20.8 billion dollars was up 2.7 percent year over year, at the high end of our guided range.  \nAdjusted EBITDA grew 4% to 12.6 billion dollars. This is our best reported quarterly EBITDA ever, with the highest growth rate in nearly four years.  \nLastly, we delivered strong free cash flow of 3.6 billion dollars, up over 900 million dollars year-overyear, enabling continued execution of our capital allocation priorities.  \nOur financial strength is notable considering the dynamic environment, marked by broad macro uncertainties, market volatility, and an evolving global trade landscape. We exited the quarter with positive sales momentum that has continued into April, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance.  \nWe are actively monitoring the tariff developments and working closely with our strategic suppliers to effectively manage the potential impacts for our customers and shareholders, as we successfully did during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, our diverse portfolio of offerings serves all segments of the market and position us for success in any economic environment.  \nLet me highlight some of the strategic moves we've made during the last 12 months that improve our ability to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth while improving the customer experience.  \nAs part of our Consumer transformation, we recently introduced a 3-year price lock and free phone guarantee for new and existing customers on myPlan. We also launched My Biz Plan, which extends the same control, value and simplicity to our small and medium-sized business customers. Our dedication to improving customer experience is reflected in our ongoing development of customerfirst offerings and our brand refresh.  \nWe accelerated our broadband expansion plans by increasing our organic build pace and through the pending acquisition of Frontier.  \nAnd we announced our AI Connect offerings to enable AI at scale and open up new revenue streams, and executed on satellite partnerships that enable texting anywhere, for free.  \nOur network continues to be a key differentiator.  The C-band deployment remains ahead of plan and on track to cover 80 to 90 percent of our planned sites by year end. We are aggressively rolling out 5G Advanced features and making the best 5G network even better. We are also tracking ahead of our FiOS build plans and are on track to deliver 650 thousand incremental passings this year. Our multi-dwelling unit solution for fixed wireless access was recently launched in more than 15 markets, and is expected to gradually ramp up over time. Lastly, we once again earned the top spot in the industry, claiming Best 5G, Fastest 5G, and Most Reliable 5G in the 2024 RootMetrics second half drive tests.  \nShifting to operational performance, the breadth of our product portfolio, which covers all market segments, delivered year-over-year improvement in our combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds.  We had a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn in Consumer from our recent pricing actions, and pressure from federal government accounts. We continue to execute on our multi-year business transformation effort in Consumer, and remain confident to deliver full-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds. Our prepaid net adds of 137 thousand were the best since the TracFone acquisition and represent a significant year-over-year improvement. Our prepaid brands play a critical role in our segmented-market strategy to ensure we have targeted offerings for all customers.  \nIn Broadband, we continued to take share and grew our subscriber base with our dual Fixed Wireless Access and fiber strategy, adding 339 thousand subscribers in the quarter. With Fixed Wireless Access and fiber, we have the most complete offering, covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over time. Our Fixed Wireless Access product continues to lead the broadband growth and we have great momentum to reach our next milestone 8 to 9 million Fixed Wireless Access subscribers by 2028. We are excited to expand our broadband opportunity and continue to scale upon closing of our pending Frontier acquisition.  \nAnd our private networks business continues to scale. We closed more than a dozen deals in the quarter, including private networks for AdventHealth and Nucor.  \nWe were named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed IoT Connectivity Services worldwide, and reached an agreement to deliver a turnkey IoT solution for Atlanta Hawks.  \nOn AI Connect, that we presented earlier in the year, we have seen accelerated interest and continue to expand our partner ecosystem. We have added hundreds of new opportunities to our funnel in the first quarter, including some very well-known brands, and seeing particular interest in our dark fiber and wave services.  \nLooking ahead, we are confident in our strategy to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth.  \nOur innovative customer-first offerings along with the continuous improvement in our overall mobility performance position us to grow our subscriber base as we progress through the year.  \nOur growth areas such as broadband, private networks, and AI Connect are scaling rapidly and are unlocking new revenue streams using our existing assets.  \nFinally, our financial discipline is enabling successful execution of our capital allocation priorities: investing in the business for growth, supporting and growing our dividend, paying down our debt, and eventually executing on share repurchase.  \nDuring periods of elevated uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience, when our differentiators and structural advantages become even more apparent, helping to protect our business and create durability in our financial performance. And with our bias for action and our position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment, but we will thrive in it.  \nNow, I'll turn to Tony to discuss our results in greater detail.  \nAnthony Skiadas Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer  \nThanks, Hans, and good morning.  \nThis quarter proved once again that our business is resilient. We provide essential products and remain confident in our full-year guidance.  \nThe first quarter demonstrated our ability to drive strong financial results.  We delivered Wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of our guided range and our highest quarter of year over year Adjusted EBITDA growth in almost four years.  \nOur customer segmentation strategy is working. This, together with strong execution, led to an improved combined postpaid and Core prepaid phone net add performance from last year. We achieved this even with challenges in the federal government accounts and churn pressure in Consumer postpaid.  \nThis pressure caused consumer postpaid phone churn to rise by 7 basis points in the first quarter relative to last year. The increase is largely due to multiple pricing actions that were implemented over the past few months. The collective pricing changes are anticipated to yield over 1 billion dollars in incremental service revenue, allowing for greater operating flexibility for the rest of the year.  \nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 356 thousand for the first quarter, compared to 194 thousand net losses in the prior year period.  \nWe exited the first quarter with positive momentum.  Consumer postpaid phone gross adds in March were up mid-single digits from the prior year and the performance in April continues to be strong.  \nWe're encouraged by the operational trends we're seeing, and are focused on driving mobility volume growth for the full year. Our 3 Year Price Lock and Free Phone Guarantee is the next phase of our  \nConsumer transformation. This new offering was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and provides another example of our ability to innovate within the myPlan platform.  \nTurning to upgrades, the Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 3.0 percent in the first quarter, slightly lower than the prior year. We continue to see customers holding onto their phones for longer periods of time. For the full year, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by mid-single digits from 2024, reflecting an anticipated increase in volumes throughout the balance of the year.  \nOur offers are resonating in the market. We remain confident that, for the full year 2025, we will deliver year-over-year improvement in Consumer postpaid phone net adds while maintaining our financial discipline.  \nVerizon Business delivered 67 thousand phone net adds, down from 80 thousand net adds in the prior year period. We continue to evolve our offerings to provide businesses with the network solutions they need.   We recently launched My Biz Plan - a new, innovative plan structure that will better serve small and medium businesses with additional choice, value, and flexibility. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment, delivering strong volumes for the full year 2025.  \nNow, let me turn to our Core prepaid results where the improved performance more than offset the year-over-year change in total postpaid phone net adds.  \nCore Prepaid net additions were 137 thousand for the quarter, an improvement of 268 thousand from the prior year. Our strong execution and strategy to invest in the Straight Talk, Visible, and Total Wireless brands continues to pay off.  All three brands are producing strong volume growth, helping us build a high-quality customer base.  \nMoving on to broadband, we delivered 339 thousand net additions in the quarter. We are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless access offerings.  \nIn fixed wireless access, we're off to a good start to the year and remain on-track for our 8 to 9 million FWA subscriber target by 2028. We delivered 308 thousand net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 4.8 million subscribers. We see increased opportunity for expansion ahead as we further deploy our C-Band in more suburban and rural areas.  \nFios internet net adds for the first quarter were 45 thousand versus 53 thousand in the prior year period. Fios continues to be a best-in-class broadband solution, with high levels of customer satisfaction, demonstrated by strong ARPU and continued low levels of churn. We're bringing Fios to more and more communities and are on-track to reach 650 thousand new passings this year.  \nThe team is also working through the necessary steps to close the pending Frontier acquisition. We continue to expect the deal to close in early 2026. We have received regulatory approvals from several states and are continuing to work with federal and state-level agencies. We are also working through integration planning efforts to ensure a smooth transition upon deal closing. Frontier plays an important role in Verizon's broadband strategy, and we are excited about expanding our fiber footprint and accelerating our broadband growth opportunities.  \nLooking at our financials, we had a very strong first quarter and maintain a high level of confidence in reaching our financial targets for 2025.  \nTotal wireless service revenue was 20.8 billion dollars in the first quarter, up 2.7 percent year-overyear. We have taken several actions that have positioned us well for achieving service revenue growth throughout the year.  \nConsumer ARPA of $146.46 in the first quarter represented an increase of 3.6 percent year-overyear. This was primarily driven by pricing actions implemented over the past year.  \nAdditionally, the increased adoption of perks and growth in fixed wireless access subscribers continue to drive ARPA.  \nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 12.6 billion dollars, which is the highest we've ever reported and an increase of 4.0 percent compared to the prior year period. The growth was fueled by wireless service revenue coupled with the benefits from cost-saving initiatives.  \nFrom a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete and we are already realizing run rate savings, which will provide a benefit for the full year. We continue to execute on cost efficiency initiatives to further improve the financial profile of the business. Adjusted EPS was $1.19 in the quarter, up 3.5 percent year over year, primarily due to the strength in Adjusted EBITDA.  \nTurning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $7.8 billion, an increase of nearly 700 million dollars over the prior year.  The year over year growth in CFFO was primarily driven by the growth in adjusted EBITDA.  \nCapEx for the quarter came in at 4.1 billion dollars compared to $4.4 billion dollars in the prior year. Consistent with prior years, we expect the pace of capital expenditures to ramp as we get further into the year. We continue to find efficiencies with our C-Band deployment and Fios build out, allowing us to efficiently deliver more solutions within our capital envelope.  \nFree cash flow was $3.6 billion dollars in the first quarter, up over 900 million dollars, or more than 34 percent, from the prior year.  \nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $115.1 billion dollars, an $11.0 billion dollar improvement year-over-year. This was higher by $1.4 billion dollars sequentially primarily due to non cash mark to market adjustments. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.3 times improvement year over year and in-line with the prior quarter.  \nOur balance sheet continues to be a key strength of our business. Of note, we have less than 700 million dollars in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. This provides us with a clear pathway for meaningful debt reduction ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction, in alignment with our capital allocation strategy.  \nIn summary, we are pleased with the financial performance of the business in the first quarter. We delivered strong wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, as well as Free Cash Flow growth.  \nWe continue to deliver more value to our customers, including our recently launched 3 Year Price Lock and Free Phone Guarantee. The actions we've taken to improve our postpaid phone trends are starting to bear fruit.  \nCore Prepaid is continuing to perform well and our Broadband base continues to grow.  \nWe have a recurring business that will remain resilient. Our strong financial results in the first quarter put Verizon in a position of strength to deliver better financial and customer growth in 2025.  \nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.  \nHans Vestberg Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nThank you, Tony.  \nI am proud of our team's performance in this first quarter. We remain focused on our three key financial metrics: growing Wireless Service Revenue, and expanding Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.  \nWe look forward to sharing more about how we offer more value to our customers and continue to drive both financial and subscriber growth on our 8:30 AM call this morning."

Further,  the  exclusion  of  non-operational  items  and  special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon  Business  Group  (\"Verizon  Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation  costs  and  non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain  businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued  transformation  initiatives. Asset  rationalization  recorded  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023 primarily  relates  to  Verizon  Business  network  assets  that  we  made  a  decision  to  cease  use  of  as  part  of  our  transformation  initiatives.  Legacy  legal  matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment  test.  Legal  settlement  recorded  during  2023  relates  to  the  settlement  of  a  litigation  matter  regarding  certain  administrative  fees.  Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated operating revenues.  \nWe have not provided a reconciliation  for  our  Consolidated Adjusted  EBITDA  Growth  Forecast  because  we  cannot,  without  unreasonable  effort,  predict  the special items that could arise during 2025."

                "content": "Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.  \nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities."

Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance.

Further,  the  exclusion  of  non-operational  items  and  special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon  Business  Group  (\"Verizon  Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation  costs  and  non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain  businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued  transformation  initiatives. Asset  rationalization  recorded  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023 primarily  relates  to  Verizon  Business  network  assets  that  we  made  a  decision  to  cease  use  of  as  part  of  our  transformation  initiatives.  Legacy  legal  matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment  test.  Legal  settlement  recorded  during  2023  relates  to  the  settlement  of  a  litigation  matter  regarding  certain  administrative  fees.  Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated operating revenues.  \nWe have not provided a reconciliation  for  our  Consolidated Adjusted  EBITDA  Growth  Forecast  because  we  cannot,  without  unreasonable  effort,  predict  the special items that could arise during 2025."

Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months.

We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period.  \nAdjusted  EPS  is  calculated  by  excluding  from  the  calculation  of  reported  EPS  the  effect  of  the  following  special  items:  amortization  of  acquisition-related intangible assets and severance, pension and benefits charges.  \nWe exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate.

We  believe  that  it  is  important  for  investors  to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets.  \nWe have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025."

We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.  \nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities."

                "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call of the second quarter 2025. Our performance in the first half of the year highlighted by  a  strong  second  quarter  demonstrate  that  our  strategy  is  working.  We  remain  committed  to  disciplined  execution  and  customer-centric innovation. We're growing profitable connections and the value of our customer relationships. While we always see opportunities to improve, I'm confident in the future of our business.  \nOur financial performance was strong this quarter, with a market-leading wireless service revenue of $20.9 billion, up 2.2% from last year. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year, setting another record for the best reported quarter and the second consecutive quarter with growth exceeding our guided range for the year.  \nStrong profitability drove free cash flow of $5.2 billion for the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $8.8 billion, an increase of over $300 million compared to the first half of 2024. Our cash flow from operation underscores the strength of our business and provide us flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.  \nAs a result, we continue to lead in the industry with the nation's best network. Our segmented market strategy, which is a diverse portfolio of offerings is resonating with our customers. Our customer-first offering, such as MyPlan, MyHome and the new My Biz Plan, along with our Best Value Guarantee drove significant sales momentum.  \nWe're also deploying AI-powered innovations to enhance the customer experience on the nation's best network. On the infrastructure front, our execution is outpacing our targets. C-band deployment is ahead of schedule. Our fixed wireless base has surpassed 5 million subscribers, and our fiber build is tracking ahead of its plan. This demonstrates disciplined execution across our entire portfolio.  \nGiven our financial performance and the momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We're also raising our guidance for free cash flow for the year, driven by our strong cash flow from operations and further supported by the positive impact from the tax reform. Tony will provide you with more details shortly.  \nNow, let's turn to our operational performance. In the second quarter, we delivered over 300,000 net additions across our mobility and broadband platforms. In mobility, we delivered year-over-year improvements in the combined postpaid and core prepaid phone net adds, including the fourth consecutive quarter of subscriber growth in core prepaid.  \nThe wireless market remains competitive, and we continue to take a strategic and segmented approach, maintaining our financial discipline. As expected, postpaid phone churn remained elevated this quarter, reflecting the lingering effects of our pricing actions and ongoing pressure from federal government accounts.  \nWe're actively focused on improving retention by strengthening our value propositions and leveraging our AI-powered customer experience innovations. On upgrades after being down year-over-year for eight out of the last nine quarters, we saw an uptick in the second quarter, driven by our Best Value Guarantee.  \nWe continue to expect mid single-digit growth in upgrade activity for the full year. Our dual Fixed Wireless Access and fiber broadband strategy continues to drive market share gains. A key highlight is Fixed Wireless Access, which surpassed the 5 million subscribers milestone, keeping us firmly on the track to achieve our goal of 8 million to 9 million subscribers by 2028.  \nWe achieved robust broadband growth even as our C-band build-out expands into less dense markets and despite a softer move environment in our Fios footprint. We continue to scale our private network business winning a landmark deal to deploy multiple private 5G networks across the Thames Freeport. This network will serve as a technology foundation for one of UK's busiest commercial corridors, fueling a multibillion-dollar regeneration project with advanced capabilities like AI and real-time logistics.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

                "content": "Our AI Connect offerings are also generating strong interest. Our sales funnel has nearly doubled to $2 billion since launch earlier the year. While these are often complex deals with longer sales cycles, we're actively engaged in several sizable opportunities.  \nThis growth highlights the surging demand for high-bandwidth fiber capacity and diverse routes both lit and dark fiber to serve different customer needs. As AI transitions from centralized training to widespread real-time applications, compute power at the network edge becomes essential. Our existing infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support this evolution.  \nOur network is our key differentiator, consistently delivering top performance. This quarter, J.D. Power once again recognized Verizon for the best network quality and RootMetrics first half year 2025 awards named us the nation's best, fastest, and most reliable 5G network. We're building on this advantage every day.  \nOur C-band deployment is ahead of schedule and on track to cover 80% to 90% of planned sites by year-end, with nearly all sites now standalone capable. Our fiber build is tracking ahead of plan, and we're positioned to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year.  \nMeanwhile, the regulatory approval process for our pending acquisition of Frontier is progressing as planned. We're encouraged by Frontier's performance and look forward to closing the transaction to further accelerate our fiber expansion.  \nAs we near the closing of Frontier acquisition, we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, broadband expansion and capital allocation considering all stakeholders. We look forward to providing an update in the next few months.  \nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tony to go into the financials in more detail."

                "content": "Thanks, Hans, and good morning. The first half of the year reaffirms the strength of our business, highlighting the effective execution of our disciplined strategy and significant progress towards achieving our financial goals. As a leading provider of essential connectivity across the US, we are committed to offering the best value and delivering the best service and customer experience within the industry.  \nWe are focused on driving wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow. The second quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong financial results even in a period of elevated promotional activity and broad economic uncertainty.  \nWe remain focused on high-quality, profitable growth, recognizing that volume growth is only valuable when aligned with our disciplined financial framework. Our goal is to improve volumes year-over-year, but we will not do this at the expense of delivering on our three key financial priorities.  \nThis past quarter, we achieved strong sales focusing on high-quality customers without overspending for growth. Even with Public Sector challenges and ongoing Consumer postpaid phone churn pressure, we maintained our financial discipline.  \nWithin Consumer, second quarter postpaid phone gross additions were up sequentially and year-over-year. Our sales execution remains strong, leveraging our attractive value proposition, including the recent launch of the Best Value Guarantee.  \nAs expected, we saw the residual effects of our first quarter pricing actions impact our second quarter Consumer postpaid phone churn. Additionally, we continue to see elevated competitor promotional activity. As a result, second quarter Consumer postpaid phone churn remained consistent with the first quarter at that 0.90%.  \nWe have taken a series of actions to address our elevated churn. On June 24, we launched initiatives designed to improve the customer experience, including leveraging AI for more personalized support. In addition, we continue to enhance our value proposition and build customer loyalty through the Best Value Guarantee.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

                "content": "We provide exclusive access to the best events and experiences, and our refreshed app helps customers maximize the value of their plans. Mobility phone net adds, which includes both consumer and business retail postpaid as well as core prepaid, were 16,000 for the second quarter. This represents an improvement of 25,000 from the prior year period.  \nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 51,000 for the second quarter compared to 109,000 net losses in the prior year period as we benefited from strong gross adds. Verizon Business delivered 42,000 phone net adds in the second quarter compared with 135,000 net adds in the prior year period.  \nA significant majority of the year-over-year decline was driven by the Public Sector business. Though we anticipate Public Sector pressures to persist in the second half of the year, we expect the impact to subside towards the end of the year.  \nConsistent with our wireline approach, we continue to remain disciplined and not pursue low-margin wireless business or overpay for volumes. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment and deliver healthy volumes for the full year of 2025.  \nCore prepaid net additions were 50,000 for the quarter an improvement of 62,000 from the prior year period. This marks four consecutive quarters of positive core prepaid net adds, reflecting the strong execution of the team. The Visible, Total Wireless and Straight Talk brands continue to perform well and are progressively building a high-quality business.  \nOverall, core prepaid ARPU rose above $32 and we have now reached an inflection point where after four quarters of volume growth, we expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth for the remainder of the year.  \nTurning to total wireless postpaid upgrades. We saw a 14% increase in the first half of the year as compared to the same period of 2024. This result was driven by a healthy initial uptake of our Best Value Guarantee program, which is an investment in our high-quality customer base. As Hans said earlier, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by a mid single-digit percentage in 2025 as compared to 2024.  \nMoving on to broadband. We delivered 293,000 net additions in the quarter. We are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and Fixed Wireless Access offerings, even with seasonal impacts and a softer move environment as compared to prior years.  \nIn Fixed Wireless Access, we delivered 278,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 5.1 million subscribers. FWA demand remains strong, and we are on track to deliver our goal of 8 million to 9 million FWA subscribers by 2028.  \nFios internet net adds for the second quarter were 32,000 versus 28,000 in the prior year period. Fios provides customers with industry leading connectivity and delivers high customer satisfaction reflected in both robust ARPU and consistently low churn rates. We are expanding our Fios footprint and remain on track to deliver 650,000 new passings in 2025.  \nAs we talk about fiber, let me provide a brief update on the pending Frontier transaction. The team is working through the necessary steps to complete the acquisition, and we remain on track for an early 2026 close. We have received regulatory approvals from eight states as well as the FCC and DOJ and are productively engaged with the remaining state regulatory agencies.  \nBased on Frontier's publicly reported results, the company continues to perform extremely well and remains on track with their fiber expansion goals. Our integration planning efforts are well underway, and we anticipate a smooth transition upon the deal closing. We are looking forward to having Frontier's assets serve as an important catalyst for our fiber expansion and broadband growth acceleration.  \nTurning to our financial results. We delivered another strong quarter. Second quarter consolidated revenue reached $34.5 billion, up 5.2% year over year. This result was driven by solid wireless service revenue and a more than 25% increase in wireless equipment revenue. Services and other revenue rose 1.6%. Total wireless service revenue reached $20.9 billion in the second quarter, a 2.2% increase year over year.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \nGrowth was driven by consumer ARPA, which rose 2.3% year over year. We realized benefits from recent pricing actions, expansion of Fixed Wireless Access, and increased revenue from perks and other adjacent services. Our robust perk offerings continue to grow at a steady pace, keeping us on track to achieve our goal of 15 million perks by year end and providing a healthy contribution to service revenue.  \nIn addition, prepaid revenue has reached a turning point and was flat in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. We expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we are well positioned for continued service revenue growth with healthy underlying customer economics.  \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.8 billion which is the highest we have ever reported and an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year period. Wireless service revenue growth coupled with the benefits from cost savings initiatives more than offset the impact from the elevated upgrade activity.  \nThrough the first half of 2025, both wireless service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are up nearly $1 billion from the prior year, reflecting strong operating leverage. Within that result, the Business segment EBITDA has now grown for three consecutive quarters on a year over year basis.  \nFrom a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete, generating substantial savings. In addition, we're actively pursuing opportunities within our legacy businesses. These include copper decommissioning and savings from the managed services initiative within our business segment, among other cost efficiency programs. Adjusted EPS was $1.22 in the quarter, up 6.1% year over year, primarily due to the strength in Adjusted EBITDA.  \nTurning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of the year was $16.8 billion, up more than 1% compared with the same period a year ago. CapEx for the first half of 2025 came in at $8 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year period. We continue to realize efficiencies in our C-band deployment and Fios expansion, enabling us to effectively meet or exceed our network goals well within our capital budget.  \nFor the first half of the year, the net effect of Cash flow from operations and CapEx resulted in free cash flow of $8.8 billion, an increase of 3.6% compared to the same period a year ago. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $116 billion, a $6.9 billion improvement year over year. In the first half of the year, our debt reduction was offset by non-cash mark to market adjustments.  \nOur net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.2 times improvement year over year and in line with the prior quarter. We continue to make progress towards our long-term leverage target ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction.  \nOur balance sheet remains a significant strength of our organization. Notably, we have under $700 million in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. We will continue to focus on reducing debt ahead of completing the Frontier transaction.  \nAs Hans mentioned earlier, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will continue to strategically invest in the business, enhancing our mobile and broadband networks, support a healthy and growing dividend and paying down debt towards our long-term leverage target.  \nAs we've mentioned previously, we'll consider buybacks once we reach our leveraged target. Our strong operational execution in the first half of the year coupled with favorable tax reform gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for the full year.  \nGiven the strong Adjusted EBITDA performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year guidance to 2.5% to 3.5% growth, an increase of approximately $125 million at the midpoint.  \nWe are increasing our guidance for Adjusted EPS growth to a range of 1% to 3% to reflect a new Adjusted EBITDA outlook.  \nWe are raising our 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion. The increase is driven by an estimated benefit of $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the recently enacted tax legislation as well as the disciplined operational execution that drove our strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance in the first half of the year.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \nOur wireless service revenue and CapEx guidance remains unchanged. As we get closer to the closing of the Frontier transaction, we expect to provide an update on our broadband plans as well as our capital allocation strategy.  \nIn summary, we have a resilient business model with a high-quality customer base and continue to execute well on both mobility and broadband. Our second quarter financial performance reflects our disciplined approach to growth, and we are well positioned to deliver on our improved outlook in the second half of the year.  \nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nThank you, Tony. Our strong first half results reaffirm our confidence in Verizon's strategy. Our strategic execution and the ongoing momentum across our business underpin our decision to raise full year guidance. Our focus remains clear. We are committed to growing wireless service revenue, expanding Adjusted EBITDA and generating strong free cash flow.  \nWe will achieve this through three key priorities. First, building on our network leadership to create compelling customer offerings that accelerate growth in our mobility and broadband businesses. Secondly, maintaining operational excellence and financial discipline across the organization.  \nThirdly, scaling our next-generation platforms from capturing new enterprise opportunities with private networks to enabling AI at scale and unlocking new revenue streams from our existing assets.  \nThe opportunities ahead are significant and the pending Frontier acquisition will accelerate our fiber strategy.  \nVerizon's unique market position and the essential nature of our services are fundamental to empowering individuals, businesses and society. Verizon has the assets, the strategy, and most importantly, the team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunities ahead.  \nWith that, Brady, it's time for Q&amp;A.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for questions."

                "content": "Thank you. Let me start with the capital allocation. I think your comments and question there is more than valid. As you saw, we raised our guidance for free cash flow, partly because of our cash flow from operation is improving, but also the tax reform that we indicated on how much it is.  \nAs I said before, I mean, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. I mean it's, first of all, in our business, and we have increased the CapEx this year compared to 2024. The dividend, of course, 18 years of increase. We want to put the Board in a position to continue to grow. We paid down our debt. We paid down our debt again with almost $3 billion in the first half, and then it will be buybacks.  \nNow, we are in a situation where we are getting closer to the expected (corrected by company after the call)next year closing of Frontier. So what I said in my prepared remarks is I want to get a holistic view on all the capital allocation. I mean how we're going to invest in fiber, what synergies we see, how we're going to do the capital allocation priorities.  \nBut clearly, the tax reform is helping us to get faster to the priorities we have. So we feel good about that. But let me come back to that. So I think we can give you a holistic view on capital allocation. But clearly, we're very excited about Frontier. The performance is great. The synergies are great. And of course, the convergence and the fiber opportunities are also great. So very excited for that. And so far, Frontier has performed really good.  \nOn the wireless consumer, I think that our ambition as was outlined by Sampath in the beginning of the year doing better this year is still valid. I mean there's no difference on that. However, we're going to continue to be very financially disciplined.  \nFor us, we will not sacrifice our financials, but you're still getting net adds if it doesn't make sense. If it's too expensive. You saw us in the fourth quarter last year being aggressive because we saw the opportunities of creating and gaining a lot of high-quality customers.  \nYou saw our gross adds in second quarter. So it all depends on where the market is and where we go, but ultimately, our goal is to increase our service revenue and then expand our Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. That's our main KPIs.  \nAnd then on churn, Tony will probably chime in on all of this. But on churn, expected in the second quarter was elevated coming from the prices, but also from the competitive environment. I think the whole industry is up, Sampath put in a lot of very important churn measurements, 624. That now is working going through our system. All our AI-empowered customer service impacting.  \nSo very encouraged about what the team is doing and how they are working on the loyalty and retention of our customers. So that's all. A little bit Tony will chime in on all three, I guess.  \nAnthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \nYeah. Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Ben. So a couple of things on churn. Obviously, we're focused on reducing churn in a financially disciplined manner. And as Hans mentioned, we have a great value proposition with the Verizon value guarantee and also My Biz on the business side.  \nWe have further deployment of C-band. We said we're going to get to 80% to 90% of C-band this year deployed, and we see lower churn where C-band is deployed. And then the work that Hans mentioned on customer experience, we did a CX launch on June 24. And that work is also augmented by AI, and we expect to see improvements there. And then obviously, convergence will also reduce mobility churn. And the team has the retention tools to get there, and they're focused on it.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

First, it looks like you saw a further deceleration in postpaid ARPA growth. Can you just talk a little bit about the drivers that are causing that deceleration?  \nAnd then a follow-up on one of the comments. The upgrade rates in the teens in the first half, do you expect mid-single digits for the year. What's the driver of the -- what would suggest to be a pretty rapid deceleration in the upgrades? Thanks.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nThank you. On the postpaid ARPA, I think, again, I mean, we have been growing our ARPA for a long time, and we continue to. We have many levers in there all the way from our broadband by step-ups, only 50% of our customers on MyPlan. We had the adjacent services. You heard when we had our prepared remarks on our perks basically doubling this year, up to 15 million perks. So we have a lot of drivers for it. So we still believe that we have a good run rate on that.  \nOn the upgrades, as you articulated, we have been down eight quarters of the last nine when it comes to upgrades for many reasons. This quarter, we put in, first of all, a couple of incentives for customers to upgrade. So that's why we saw a little bit higher. But remember, when we talk about the mid single digits, that both business and consumer. That's the total investment we're having in upgrades.  \nAnthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \nAnd then just a couple of other points on the upgrades. I mean, we absorbed the higher upgrades. The upgrades were up 30% year-over-year, and we still produced strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter. So we had good operating leverage across the board there.  \nBrady Connor  \n- Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nYeah. Thanks, John.

As we think about the consumer net add results in the quarter, any way to unpack maybe free line contribution intra core? I know that was a below-the-line offer that was in market as well.  \nAnything to quantify or read through from the deceleration in core prepaid down pretty materially sequentially. Is there any migration activity within the quarter there? And then lastly, on the Frontier deal close, you said early 2026. Is that implying a later-than-expected close versus 1Q '26 was the previous guidance given maybe some utility commission reviews that are ongoing out there. Thank you."

But of course, what we saw here in the second quarter was a way lower mover market. I mean, the product is the best product out there. The churn is very low, performing really well.  \nOn the Fixed Wireless Access, it's the same phenomenon we talked before, as we go suburban and rural to the 80%, 90% of C-band, that's where we create the opportunities for Fixed Wireless Access as is a secondary business case on our build.  \nAnd that means that we have less passing or whatever we call it, in Fixed Wireless Access world, where less open for sale. So that's very natural. If I look into the second quarter, I'm pretty certain we will do better on broadband in the second half this year than we did in the first."

That is more than trials right now, even though it's a smaller scale, where in many states, we'll start rolling it out. And we want to have a short time period between we have the product and we talk to the landlords.  \nIt's going to start scaling even more in the second half. I think it will be a bigger contributor in '26 than in '25, but it's a great product that can get very, very good broadband services all the way up to 1 gigabyte, which is something extraordinary that the guys have been doing. But we will scale to see that we have the highest quality that Verizon is known for and is our trademark.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nThanks, Jim.

And if you can share how Verizon is looking to differentiate your converged offers versus the competition.  \nAnd then on EBITDA, you referenced that it was up 4% in the second quarter, first half and that's better than the guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. So can you unpack within the full year guidance, like what you're anticipating for the rest of the year? And what are the factors that would put you at the high end versus the low end of that range?"

But on the convergence, I think that, of course, our main key differentiator is that we have owner's economics on mobility and broadband. We have the biggest mobility base and we're now adding our fiber base with Frontier.  \nSo we're going to have an unparalleled opportunity for convergence that our customers have a chance to work on both. And as I said before, we have a very high degree of our broadband net adds per quarter that are already converged.  \nSo it's more about when we're going to scale that opportunity, we have even more chances and if you think about coming into the Frontier footprint when that's approved, we have a huge opportunity for convergence. So we're excited over that and that's our offering.  \nAnd on EBITDA, before Tony says something, I think you see right now our leverage, the cost takes out we've done, the growth we're doing and it's falling straight down to the bottom line and we will continue to focus on that. As I said so many times before, the whole executive management and the whole company had three KPIs. It's the wireless service revenue growth, and then it's Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation. So very good start of the year."

So on the Adjusted EBITDA, we were up over $500 million in the quarter and about $1 billion of Adjusted EBITDA growth year-to-date, and that's also in light of having a pretty significant upgrade activity mostly driven by the launch of our Value Guarantee.  \nAnd we stayed very disciplined in the quarter. We didn't chase volumes. And they gave us the confidence that resiliency in the business gave us the confidence to raise the guide. And it starts with the top line revenue and wireless service revenue is up 2.4% year-to-date. So we're seeing great operating leverage, as Hans mentioned.  \nAnd there's a lot of work going on the cost side of the house to continue to make the business a lot more efficient in serving customers day in and day out. If you think about the customer care and the work we launched on June 24, that includes having AI enabled customer care, managed services.  \nWe're seeing great progress now with the managed services work that Kyle and the team are doing, and we're seeing good savings here ramping up in 2025. The network team continues to take out cost and legacy network elements that includes copper decommissioning and that work is ongoing.  \nAnd then even in Business Wireline, we continue to de-emphasize low-margin deals and stay very disciplined there. And then from a headcount standpoint, the voluntary separation program is now behind us, and we're seeing a full run rate benefit for the balance of the year.  \nSo there's really no assumption changes in upgrades, as you asked before. We said mid single-digits for the full year. That still stays intact. And what we've said is volumes are important, but we're going to stay disciplined in our approach and in support of the three measures that Hans mentioned wireless service revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

I know you pulse in and out of the market, Tony, just like you said, but looking through some of your postpaid offers in the second quarter, at times, there seems to have been a bit more promotional activity on the device side, targeting the value end.  \nOver the last few years, you've expanded your portfolio in the segments that you target with TracFone and Fixed Wireless, for example. But the value end had historically been perhaps less of a focus on the postpaid side. So I was curious if this was more of an opportunistic tilt that was specific to the quarter or if it's part of a more strategic shift in the way that you expect to go to market moving forward?

First of all, Sampath and the team together with our CMO, Leslie, have been working really hard to segment up our market because as we see the market having less and less new customers come into the market, a segmented approach becomes important. We are running now, I think, eight or nine different brands. All of them have different brand attributes and appealing to different segmentations.  \nSo this is sort of a segmented growth strategy we have in wireless for Consumer, and that will continue. And you just refine and see that we have the right offerings in all the different type of brands we have. I would say some of the brands are doing extraordinary well. I mean, Total Wireless, Visible, very good, very targeted. Some of them have some sort of promotions. Some of them are just having a service fee.  \nSo it's very different, and you're going to see us continue doing that work because that is part of our growth story that we can actually meet any consumer with different economical background with the service. And as you can see in this quarter and the previous quarters, we're actually excited about those opportunities.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nYeah.

And by next year, we're going to have basically built all our C-band on top of the grid we defined from the beginning. And after that, we can always debate how we're going to continue to allocate capital.  \nBut right now, we allocate capital for mobility for the simple reason that where we build the C-band, we have better step ups, we have better upgrades from our customers. So that's the number one. But let us finish this and then we're going to see, but the pace has not changed, the same C-band build-out.  \nWhat you see on the CapEx is actually also an efficiency work. We're doing everything that was planned for '25 right now, but we do it more efficient. The network team is doing a great job, actually creating efficiencies on our CapEx.

Under the new budget or the One Big, Beautiful Bill, there is an expectation of significant spectrum sales, even though the spectrum hasn't been identified, can you just talk a little bit about that as to how you would prioritize spectrum purchases. If there's either a government action or alternatively if private market spectrum comes available from EchoStar as to how that might affect, for example, your discussion about possible share buybacks.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nThank you. When it comes to spectrum, I mean, I think that what we are -- we're sitting on a really good position on spectrum and with a C-band, millimeter wave, or a low band, and that's what you see we are deploying right now. So we feel good about where we are with spectrum.  \nThen I've said all the time that the US over time needs more spectrum, especially as 6G comes up, et cetera, in order to stay competitive and being the most digitalized country in the world. So we're, of course, thinking is good. That's part of the bill. But as you rightfully said, it still needs to be freeing up spectrum and all of that, and that will take some time.  \nWhen it comes to in general capital allocation of spectrum, we always do the build versus buy. I mean, we have done it way before I joined. We look into will this -- buy the spectrum being better than building our own spectrum today. That's the comparison of what it's going to do when we see spectrum in the market."

To give you an exact number, that wouldn't be appropriate.  \nBut I think that what you should be feeling confident about it that we weekly think about what is the best allocation that we get the best return on investment on the LTV and getting the right customers of retention or acquisitions.  \nSo that is a fluid work we're doing constantly, and we have improved this dramatically over the years.

                "content": "Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \nOkay. Sure, Greg. On the gross adds, a couple of things here. The strength came from two places. First, we had very strong sales execution in our stores and distribution. The team did a great job. And then secondly, the value proposition when you think about -- we launched the Best Value Guarantee back at the beginning of April, and that is resonating with customers in the market.  \nAnd we see a healthy mix of new to Verizon in the quarter, and we're also writing good business as well. And what we said many times is volumes are important, and we'll pulse in and pulse out where it makes financial sense. And then as we said earlier, the biggest opportunity for us is loyalty and retention, and the team is focused on it.  \nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \nYeah. And if we talk about what was launch 624, I think that it was a lot of AI supported customer experience tools we put in. I mean, first of all, when it comes to the process, we now will have a customer care employee following a request or a complaint from our customers all the way. So we actually finish it out with the same person starting and ending and also having uptake. That was a concern for our customers that we heard through the year and that we needed to improve.  \nThe other thing is we're also opening up for our customer service 24/7, very important. Again, that was a feedback that people are having different work hours. They want to call different times. We're going to fix that. And then, of course, we're giving our customer care employees an AI tool so they can treat our customer better and know their problems better because this could be stressful. We know that having the connectivity is such an essential service mobility in broadband.  \nAnd then the last thing, we're going to leverage even more our stores. I mean, 93% of the US population has less than 30 minutes of Verizon store. We're going to leverage that more, see that's going to be a place where you can get more support and help as well. So we leverage all the assets and all our employees to see that we're treating our customers better.  \nAnd I think it's an area we can excel in, and then we basically have worked a lot on our product side, where we have MyPlan, My Biz, MyHome, all of that with perks, which is really resonating. We have worked on a brand that we refreshed the brand last year, and that is actually going really good as well. And the network is, of course, the best network in the market that once again was proven by J.D. Power and RootMetrics.  \nSo we're working on all the cylinders how we compete for any type of customer all the way from enterprise government, small and medium to prepaid, postpaid customers, and broadband and mobility. So it's a holistic thinking how we're going to do this. Thank you for the question.  \nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \nThanks, Greg.

And we see, obviously, headcount is flat year-to-date in your reporting compared to 5% improvement or decline in 2024.  \nAnd so, thinking out medium term, thinking about 2026, 2027, I wonder if you could describe any opportunities you see for ongoing efficiency gains outside of price increases. And then on churn, now that we're well past the impact of extended installment plans on consumer churn, what  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"

I think that both Tony and I see more cost opportunities than we have seen in a long time. And that's what you see in our leverage right now. Many of the AI solutions were put in, we talked about them last year, we're putting into both in the capital planning for our customers, for our employees. That's still not into any cost base for us.  \nThe headcount, we have been very, very good and it's going down all the time. So we have been very efficient on managing our resources that is handling this market. So very happy with that. And I hand it over to Tony to talk a little bit more about cost and churn."

And as I said earlier, we had a lot of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in the first half and continue to take cost out, whether it's AI, whether it's network, the team continues to take copper out of the network, and that work continues. And whether it's IT or real estate, IT platform consolidation of real estate, we're continuing to push cost out of the business.  \nAnd even on Business Wireline, as I said before, we're being really disciplined at the deal desk. And even on wireless, we're being disciplined at the deal desk as well, and we're not chasing growth for the sake of growth. So as Hans said, we're operating differently, and we feel good about the cost actions that are driving the Adjusted EBITDA improvements and also the increase in the guide."

The other areas, of course, we have been building since the first BEAD opportunity came up.  \nSo the combination of this is probably that we have the same opportunities as we had when the BEAD program started. We're going to BEAD where we see that we have a good return and with some subsidies from the government. So no major change for us. We are in this process right now.

We took a lot of decisions, including getting basically a new management team. Since then, we have been aligning on what we need to do, and you see so many vectors of growth that we didn't have before. I mean, all the way from fiber, Fixed Wireless Access and of course the fiber will be added in the Frontier over time.  \nYou see our AI Connect that we talk about on the business side so that we can leverage our assets on the on the fixed side. We have the adjacent services that for a couple of years ago were very small. Now, with the perks and all of that we're doubling the growth there.  \nSo we have the convergence coming up as well. We have prepaid that Tony talked about that was zero or negative for us for quite a while. Now, we're basically flattish and of course, expecting that the team is going to. And then we have all the step up and the segmented growth that I talked about.  \nSo the team is executed really good and, in the foundation, we have a great network that we now are sort of capturing all the opportunities we receive an investment we did for a couple of years ago, and that's what you see. And then on top of that with the discipline from Tony and the team, we're taking out cost and then you see the leverage and sometimes we just underestimate what great business this is.  \nI mean, it's an enormous business when it comes to revenue and subscriber-based services and the generation of cash is extraordinary. We will just continue to drive that and see that we have the right offerings for our customer, but that's what's behind it. We're really well executed and what you should expect from Verizon, which is our trademark."

The team continues to grow volumes, both mobility and FWA and the business continues to skew more wireless, which is great to see, and we said the goal was to improve the EBITDA profile in this segment, and we saw really good progress in the first half of the year.  \nWe have three straight quarters now of growth. So if you look at between the revenue and the margins on the revenue side, as I said, more wireless FWA and mobility growing even though we're growing through even the Public Sector pressures as well. And we're also seeing contributions from private 5G networks and AI Connect, and that's also offsetting some of the wireline decline that we see.  \nAnd then on the cost side, Kyle and the team are doing a great job with our managed services transformation, the deal we signed with HCL is providing a lot of benefits this year and a lot of good discipline in terms of moving customers off of legacy progress -- products rather, and  \nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us"
