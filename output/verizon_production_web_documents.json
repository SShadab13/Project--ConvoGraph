      "content": "# The network America relies on\n\n## Welcome to the fully networked economy.\n\nToday, we live in a world where we all work, learn, create and even stay safe using networks—built on the 21st-century infrastructures of mobility, broadband and the cloud. We call this new world the fully networked economy.\n\n5G is not another incremental technological innovation impacting this networked economy. It’s a once-in-a-generation breakthrough platform that has the potential to dramatically change what we think is possible.\n\nVerizon has a history of network leadership, something that consumers recognize. Verizon has earned more awards than any other provider for Wireless Network Quality according to J.D. Power.1 That leadership is a driving force behind the work to unlock the full potential of this fully networked economy.\n\n## Leading the way: Advancing Verizon’s amazing 5G network²\n\nWe've continued that leadership spirit by undergoing a massive network transformation that is allowing us to set the stage for even greater 5G development and adoption. Our spectrum position, our extensive fiber ownership and the advanced technology we deploy from the core of our network all the way to the edge of our network makes Verizon’s 5G network reliable, robust, secure and high performing. And that makes us America’s most reliable 5G network3.\n\nA huge part of our network transformation is network virtualization. Key 5G use cases like massive scale IoT solutions, more robust consumer devices, AR/VR, remote healthcare and autonomous robotics in manufacturing environments will all heavily rely on the programmability of virtualized networks. Virtualization is critical for advanced operations and services, which require a programmable network with the ability to move functions and operations across the distributed network.\n\nAdditionally, the advanced electronics we use in our fiber network in combination with the vastness of that fiber footprint help provide the capacity we need to move today’s data and help support the exponential growth in data from the mobile network in the future that should result from new 5G uses.\n\nFinally, our spectrum holdings provide an excellent foundation for rapid deployment of and massive capacity on 5G, which paves the way for extraordinary innovation and growth in the future.\n\n## Why does 5G matter?\n\nNow available to more than 200 million people in the U.S., 5G Ultra Wideband can deliver life-changing technologies for both consumers and businesses. For consumers, the high speed and low latency 5G can provide means faster downloads4, HD video chatting5, and multiplayer gaming on the go with low lag6.\n\nVerizon’s 5G network and solutions for business can connect enterprise businesses and help make them smarter across industries like manufacturing, healthcare, utilities and retail. The technology we provide can help business leaders make decisions that drive Enterprise Intelligence.\n\nFor example, Associated British Ports is taking steps to become the \"port of the future\" by utilizing a Verizon Private 5G Network to enable a smart supply chain to efficiently track nearly 600,000 vehicles and over 1.2 million cruise ship passengers every year through the Port of Southampton. Network as a Service capabilities are giving businesses more scalable, secure, and cost-effective options that align with their growth. Our Labs as a Service model is connecting Verizon Innovation Labs with enterprises to troubleshoot new and emerging connected technologies and conduct proof-of-concept testing. And Verizon 5G Edge brings processing power closer to the end user, for even faster response times that can enable new, transformative applications, create efficiencies and improve customer experiences across the enterprise.\n\nGoing forward, 5G could help modernize the supply chain, transform agriculture with smarter farming and help other Internet of Things applications live up to their potential. From emergency response to global payments, next-level gaming and augmented reality, a more accessible metaverse, virtual travel and brick-and-mortar retail, the possibilities are virtually limitless.\n\n## What 5G products & plans\n\ndoes Verizon offer?1. Verizon is #1 for Network Quality in the Northeast (tied), Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, North Central, West regions. Verizon has also received the highest number of awards in network quality for the 30th time as compared to all other brands in the J.D. Power 2003-2022 Volume 1 and 2 and 2023 Volume 1 U.S. Wireless Network Quality Performance Studies. Network Quality measures customers’ satisfaction with their network performance with wireless carriers. For J.D. Power 2023 award information, visit jdpower.com/awards for more details.\n\n2. 5G access requires a 5G-capable device in a 5G coverage area.\n\n3. Most reliable 5G network based on more first place rankings in RootMetrics® 5G data reliability assessments of 125 metro markets conducted in 2H 2022. Tested with best commercially available smartphones on three national mobile networks across all available network types. Your experiences may vary. RootMetrics rankings are not an endorsement of Verizon.\n\n4. Download speeds may vary depending upon network and coverage conditions, and content optimization for 5G Ultra Wideband.\n\n5. HD availability may depend on the specific Verizon data plan in which a customer is enrolled.\n\n6. Lag dependent upon 5G spectrum used.",

      "content": "## Welcome to Verizon Voice Link Service.\n\nPlease read this agreement carefully before filing it in a safe place for future reference.\n\nIn this Agreement (“Agreement”), “you” and “your” mean the customer of Verizon Voice Link Service (“Service(s)”) defined below, and “Verizon,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean the Verizon operating companies that provide you with Service (see Exhibit A for the specific Verizon company providing the Service in your state). You acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or older, and you agree that you have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and affirm that the information you supply to us is correct and complete. Providing false or incorrect information may result in Service provisioning delays, the suspension or termination of your Service and the inability of a 911-dialed call to be correctly routed to emergency response center personnel.\n\nThis Agreement incorporates the terms of your Calling Plan. The Calling Plan includes your monthly service allowances, features and pricing. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and your Calling Plan, the terms in your Calling Plan will govern.\n\n**This Agreement becomes binding when you accept this Agreement. You accept this Agreement and Verizon’s terms and charges when you subscribe to, use or pay for the Services or tell us orally or through written or electronic means that you accept the Agreement. **\n\n**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE AND CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY TO TERMINATE IT. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE UNTIL THE SERVICE CANCELLATION DATE. **\n\n**NOTICE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT **\n\n**THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS OR JURY TRIALS (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT). PLEASE SEE SECTION 15 FOR MORE INFORMATION.**\n\n**1. SERVICE DESCRIPTION. **\n\na) Verizon Voice Link Service is solely a residential wireless voice service that provides unlimited domestic nationwide calling. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Service” shall mean Verizon Voice Link Service, including all software, equipment and other features, products and services provided by Verizon under your Calling Plan.\n\nb) The Service is not compatible with fax machines, DVR services, credit card machines, home security systems, medical alert, or other monitoring services or some High Speed or DSL Internet services.\n\nc) If the Service Device (the “Device”) is connected to a cordless phone base station, any extension phones compatible with that base station can also use the Service. If the Device is installed by a Verizon technician, the installation process will confirm that jacks utilized for telephone service within the home at the time of installation are functional with the Service.\n\nd) The Device must be connected to cordless or corded telephone hardware, as described in the Welcome Package. Never place any USB or other connector into the USB port of the Device under any circumstances. Doing so may damage the Device and negate its warranty. The USB port is designed for diagnostic purposes only, and is not intended for customer use.\n\ne) The Service requires 10-digit dialing.\n\nf) The Service does not allow the Customer to make 500, 700, 900, 950, 976, 0, 00, 01, 0+ or dial-around calls (e.g., 10-10-XXXX). Prepaid calling cards and calling cards that utilize toll-free numbers may be used, although certain other types of calling cards may not work with the Service. The Service does not allow the Customer to accept collect calls or third-number billed calls. The Company will not bill any charges on behalf of other carriers. You must have an International Calling Plan in order to make international calls.\n\ng) The Service is subject to the availability of adequate wireless coverage throughout your home, and is not available in all locations. Verizon will initially verify that adequate coverage is available at the location where the Device is placed in your home.\n\n**2. SERVICE USE AND LIMITATIONS; CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS. **\n\na) Use of Service.

You are responsible for providing the commercial power necessary for the Service to operate. The Device includes a battery backup that provides up to 72 hours of standby power for your Service with up to 2 hours of talk time in the event of a commercial power outage. After the battery is exhausted, the Service (including 911 dialing) will not function until power is restored. In addition, if the landline phone to which the Device is connected requires external electrical power to operate, the Service (including 911 dialing) will not be available during a power outage even if the backup battery is functional. A power failure or disruption may require you to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to using the Service.\n\nc) International Calling, Directory Listings and Directory Assistance.

If you activate certain features, such as three-way calling or call forwarding, additional per-minute or international charges may be incurred. You will be charged for calls forwarded to international numbers as though the forwarded calls originated from your Voice Link Service.

VOLUNTARY MEDIATION. **\n\nVerizon offers customers the option of participating in a free internal mediation program. This program is entirely voluntary and does not affect either party’s rights in any other aspect of the dispute resolution procedures outlined in Section 15. In our voluntary mediation program, we will assign an employee who is not directly involved in the dispute to help both sides reach an agreement. That person has all the rights and protections of a mediator and the process has all of the protections associated with mediation. For example, nothing said in the mediation can be used later in an arbitration or lawsuit. If you would like to know more, or you would like to start the mediation process, please contact us at NoticeofDispute@verizon.com or through Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920, for a Notice of Customer Dispute Form. A copy of the Notice of Dispute form can also be found at www.verizon.com/terms/disputes. Fill out and send the Notice of Dispute Form to us according to the directions on the form.\n\n**15. ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS. **\n\na) Our goal is customer satisfaction, but if there's an issue that needs to be resolved, this Section outlines what's expected of both of us. YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS AGREEMENT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF JURY. WHILE THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:\n\n15 (a)(i) The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Agreement. Except for small claims court cases, any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of this agreement, or from any equipment, products and services you receive from us, or from any advertising for any such products or services, or from our efforts to collect amounts you may owe us for such products or services, including any disputes you have with our employees or agents, will be resolved by one or more neutral arbitrators before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). You can also bring any issues you may have to the attention of federal, state, or local government agencies, and if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you. This agreement to arbitrate continues to apply even after you have stopped receiving service from us.\n\n15 (a)(2) UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY OF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS. For claims over $10,000, the AAA's consumer arbitration rules will apply. For claims of $10,000 or less, the party bringing the claim can choose the AAA's consumer arbitration rules or can bring an individual action in small claims court. You can get procedures, rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org) or from us. For claims of $10,000 or less, you can choose whether you would like the arbitration carried out based only on documents submitted to the arbitrator, or by a hearing in person or by phone.\n\nb) THIS AGREEMENT DOESN’T ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR MAYAWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ORPRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.\n\nc) IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. Notice to Verizon should be sent to NoticeOfDispute@verizon.com or to Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration. We’ll reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, Verizon will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If that arbitration proceeds, we'll also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\n\nd) We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer any time before the arbitration hearing. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issue an award on the claim. If you don’t accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that’s more than our offer but less than $5000, or if we don’t make you an offer, and the arbitrator awards you any amount of money but less than $5000, then we agree to pay you $5000 instead of the amount awarded. In that case we also agree to pay any reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, regardless of whether the law requires it for your case. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5000, then we will pay you only that amount.\n\ne) An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.\n\nf)** IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION 15(b) CANNOT BE ENFORCED AS TO ALL OR PART OF A DISPUTE, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY TO THAT DISPUTE OR PART OF THE DISPUTE.**\n\ng) **IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND VERIZON AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO ATRIAL BY THE COURT.**\n\n\n**v.20-1 **\n\nEffective Date: October 15, 2020\n\n\n**EXHIBIT A**\n\n|\n|\nConnecticut |\nVerizon New York Inc. |\nDelaware |\nVerizon Delaware LLC |\nMaryland |\nVerizon Maryland LLC |\nMassachusetts |\nVerizon New England Inc. |\nNew Jersey |\nVerizon New Jersey Inc. |\nNew York |\nVerizon New York Inc. |\nPennsylvania |\nVerizon Pennsylvania LLC |\nRhode Island |\nVerizon New England Inc. |\nVirginia (with exception of areas listed below) |\nVerizon Virginia Inc. |\nDumfries, Quantico, Prince William County, VA |\nVerizon South Inc. |\nWashington, DC |\nVerizon Washington, DC Inc. |",

      "content": "Powered by Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband, automated industrial machinery is expected to become smarter, more nimble and, ultimately, safer.\n\nFrom the assembly line to the fulfillment center, automated machinery already plays a vital role in industrial processes. That kind of factory automation, however, is just the tip of the articulated robotic arm.\n\nThe advent of 5G has the potential to drive a massive change in digitized operations, opening up a broad playbook of all-new robotic applications and having a transformative impact on everything from production to inventory management to warehouse logistics.\n\n“There’s no area more prepared for positive 5G disruption than the manufacturing industry,” confirms Thierry Sender, director of IoT and real-time enterprise product strategy at Verizon. “5G should deliver never-before-seen enhancements and improvements to all aspects of industry.”\n\nAn ultra-fast, low-latency network should help enable robots to become fully integrated pieces of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A next-gen network also has the potential to radically increase the viability of augmented and virtual reality on the factory floor, changing the way robots and humans work together. Ultimately, robotics in the age of 5G can make operations more efficient while also improving worker safety and the bottom line.\n\n## By the numbers: 5G and robotics\n\n1 International Federation of Robotics\n\n2 World Economic Forum\n\n3 Future of Jobs Report 2018, World Economic Forum\n\n4 Extraordinary Future via Visual Capitalist\n\nRapid factory reconfiguration\n\nRarely is a factory floor a static patch of real estate. Massive machinery must be repositioned regularly to account for shifts in scheduling and production. These changeovers can be literally a heavy lift — and that’s before factoring in proximity to fixed power sources or precision recalibration.\n\nBut with 5G, industrial robots have the potential to get smaller, lighter and easier to move from A to B. With 5G, less computing power is needed aboard a robot because complex functions can be performed on nearby servers, with negligible impact on machine responsiveness. This means clunky processors and giant batteries can be stripped from robots, reducing their form factors and drastically increasing their mobility. In some cases, a piece of machinery that was previously tethered to an electrical outlet may be freed to move nimbly around the floor—even autonomously.\n\nWhen factories can be retooled efficiently, production uptime can increase. More importantly, limiting the movement of heavyweight equipment reduces the risk of worker injury.\n\nComputing on the fly\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles, or AEVs, already perform inventory management functions in large warehouses, but with 5G, their operational value to organizations could soar.\n\nPicture a drone buzzing through a fulfillment center, scanning barcodes, recording the location of products to be retrieved and shipped. The drone moves from shelf to shelf, row to row, storing data that will eventually be downloaded onto a central server and algorithmically analyzed so that scheduling and restocking decisions can be made. By any measure, this is quite a feat, something scarcely imaginable even a decade ago.\n\nProvided with a next-gen network, however, drones are expected to more seamlessly incorporate artificial intelligence into their routines, and instead of scanning barcodes, they should identify entire products at a glance using computer vision, processing gathered information in near-real time using cloud-based applications. Valuable time won’t be wasted waiting for the drone to dock and upload its cache of data. Rather, it will be sent over the air. And because the onboard compute and battery power have been minimized, the drones themselves can shrink.\n\nThe anticipated benefits: more decision-making power essentially in real time, lower product loss and a 360-degree, always-on view of stock, from check-in to ship out.\n\n“There’s no area more prepared for positive 5G disruption than the manufacturing industry. 5G should deliver never before seen enhancements and improvements to all aspects of industry.”\n\n— Thierry Sender, director of IoT and real-time enterprise product strategy at Verizon\n\nRobot patrol\n\nFrom automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, rolling through the production floor using computer vision, to autonomous industrial lift trucks relying on equal parts strength and artificial intelligence, mobile robotics are predicted to fundamentally change the way humans and goods navigate a busy workspace.\n\nConsider a worker using a forklift to move a stack of nestable pallets. Unforeseen obstacles or misoperation can lead to damaged product or machinery, or worse yet, serious injury. But with 5G, autonomous vehicle technology can put the forklift in constant sensor contact with its surroundings, adding precision to its path and minimizing human error. In some cases, workers won’t need to be behind the wheel at all, instead relying on augmented and virtual reality —technologies that are expected to become truly viable with the speed and low latency of 5G—to guide machines from remote locations.\n\nAGVs can also “know” more about what they’re hauling—what it is, where it needs to go and how best to get it there—so companies can maintain secure custody chains and avoid costly write-downs owing to misplaced inventory.\n\nNo-code machine reprogramming\n\nTraining a human worker to perform a new task can be time-consuming, but training a robot to take on a new job can be virtually impossible. 5G network technology, however, can provide some companies with a unique way of expanding the capabilities of their robotic forces. Using augmented reality and artificial intelligence, robots should become more adaptable.\n\nBeing able to simply tell a robot what to do and rely on it to figure out how—repurposing a depalletizing tool to assist in physical inspection, for instance—will be a gamechanger for many industries. In addition to the obvious cost benefits, companies can accelerate redeployments, optimize workflows and get the most out of their employees.\n\nAs these technologies demonstrate, advanced automation may ultimately change the nature of what humans are responsible for on the job site.\n\nThe future is 5G\n\n5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. But users will know it as one of the fastest, most robust technologies the world has ever seen. That means not only quicker downloads, but also richer immersive experiences that have a massive impact on how we live, work, learn and play. The connectivity benefits of 5G will make businesses more efficient and give consumers access to more information faster than ever before. Autonomous cars, smart communities, industrial IoT, remote healthcare—they all will rely on 5G.\n\n“We talk about 5G as the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” says Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg. “What we are doing is transformational. Here at Verizon, we not only have the best network for today, but also for tomorrow. It’s why we always say: We don’t wait for the future. We build it.”\n\nIs your business ready for 5G?\n\nOur 5G assessment and technology adoption tool will help you see how ready you are.

      "content": "# What is Finsta?\n\n## And what to do if your kid has one.\n\n\nSay you’re checking Instagram and notice a comment on one of the family pics. The wording sounds just like your kid. Right down to the emojis. But the Instagram handle isn’t familiar, so you click around, follow up and—Oh, hello. It’s your kid, in every picture, but it’s not the same account you’ve been following and liking. That’s exactly how most parents find out about a Finsta, or Finstagram.\n\nFirst, a word of assurance: It’s totally normal to be freaked out the first time. For your teen, these fake accounts are usually private, involve a small following of close friends, where they post things they really don’t want you or the rest of the world to see. Finsta is not an app—it’s just a secondary Instagram profile that can’t be tied to their real name. It’s a place where kids can feel safe about simply being the risky, goofy teenager they’re hardwired to be, experts say.\n\nThat’s also why stumbling across your kid’s fake account is an important milestone in your digital parenting life. We asked a few experts to weigh in on the top things you’ll want to know:\n\n#### You probably had your own version of a Finsta\n\nIf your parents started trolling the skate park—or whatever mall you tried to terrorize back in the day—you’d probably find another place to hang, right? Another park or another kid’s house. In most situations, that’s what’s happening when your teen starts a Finsta, says Laura Tierney, founder of The Social Institute. Tierney works with students nationwide helping them navigate social media in positive, high character ways.\n\nFinstas started showing up shortly after Instagram launched\n\nInstagram launched in 2010, and in 2011, Twitter users started posting screenshots from their Finsta or “Fake Instagram accounts.” They’ve been growing steadily ever since.\n\n#### Here’s how to know if your kid has one: Ask\n\nDon’t be afraid to say, “Hey, I just heard about this Finsta thing. Do you have one? What is it?” says Dr. Nicole Beurkens, a licensed psychologist who specializes in working with teens and families.\n\n“As a parent, you’d sit down with your teen and you’d look together at their Instagram account,” Beurkens says. See if they have multiple accounts that they’re managing from the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the app.\n\n#### Why it’s a good thing\n\nIt causes kids to stop and be more selective about who they’re sharing things with, Beurkens says. “And I also think there is a benefit to kids feeling like they have a curated space where they can be who they are with a small group of people that they trust.”\n\n#### What to keep your eye on\n\nWhen your teen is using a Finsta, they might assume that their small circle of friends won’t share with the outside world what’s on there. “As we tell the students, anything is sharable and screenshottable,” Tierney says. “It’s more important than ever that we post things according to our values, whether you toggle to public or private.”\n\nFrom a mental health perspective, Beurkens says it can perpetuate the idea that it’s not okay to be yourself, that you need two versions of yourself. Most parents today are on social media themselves, Beurkens says, so it’s important to model authenticity in your own lives, online and off.\n\n#### When to talk about it\n\nHuddle, don’t helicopter, to talk about it, Tierney says. A huddle is an informal, casual conversation you can have with your kids about what’s going on socially in their lives. One of the best times to huddle, according to feedback from teens that Tierney works with, is any place where there’s less direct eye contact.\n\n“Driving in the car, going to school, around the family dinner table, hanging on the weekend or going on a walk—that’s a perfect time,” Tierney says.\n\n#### What to say\n\nAsk questions and simply listen. Take in their responses and their feelings about what’s going on in their lives.\n\n“My dad would drop me off at school in the morning, and I remember he would ask me all kinds of things: What would you do in this situation? How would this make you feel? All those conversations are building empathy, and they build trust with your parents,” Tierney says.\n\nFor example, on the ride home from school: Ask your teenage daughter about her day. Ask, “Did anything fun happen on social media?”\n\nAs a parent, it’s important to turn the conversation from negative to positive, from don’ts to dos. “And if you can do that, then I am confident a student becomes more open to having conversations about technology and social media,” Tierney says.",

      "content": "# Goldman Sachs 25th Annual Communacopia Conference\n\nFran Shammo, EVP & CFO, presented at 8:00 AM ET.\n\nand Important Additional Information\n\nNOTE: In this presentation we have made forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations. Forward-looking statements also include those preceded or followed by the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “hopes” or similar expressions. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors, along with those discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies; the effects of competition in the markets in which we operate; material changes in technology or technology substitution; disruption of our key suppliers’ provisioning of products or services; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, including any increase in restrictions on our ability to operate our networks; breaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; our high level of indebtedness; an adverse change in the ratings afforded our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations or adverse conditions in the credit markets affecting the cost, including interest rates, and/or availability of further financing; material adverse changes in labor matters, including labor negotiations, and any resulting financial and/or operational impact; significant increases in benefit plan costs or lower investment returns on plan assets; changes in tax laws or treaties, or in their interpretation; changes in accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, which could result in an impact on earnings; the inability to implement our business strategies; and the inability to realize the expected benefits of strategic transactions.\n\nImportant Additional Information and Where to Find It\n\nOn September 9, 2016, Yahoo! Inc. (\"Yahoo\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") a preliminary proxy statement regarding the proposed sale of Yahoo's operating business to Verizon Communications Inc. (\"Verizon\") and related transactions, and the definitive version of which will be sent or provided to Yahoo stockholders. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, YAHOO'S STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO READ YAHOO'S PROXY STATEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE) AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE THEREIN BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS. Investors and stockholders can obtain a free copy of Yahoo's proxy statement, any amendments or supplements to the proxy statement, and other documents filed by Yahoo with the SEC in connection with the proposed transactions for no charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, on the Investor Relations page of Yahoo's website investor.yahoo.net or by writing to Investor Relations, Yahoo! Inc., 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089.\n\nYahoo and its directors and executive officers, as well as Verizon and its directors and executive officers, may be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies from Yahoo's investors and stockholders in connection with the proposed transactions. Information concerning the ownership of Yahoo securities by Yahoo's directors and executive officers is included in their SEC filings on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and additional information is also available in Yahoo's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended, and Yahoo's proxy statement for its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on May 23, 2016.

      "content": "# Web com Master Services Agreement\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION **\n\nTHIS SERVICES AGREEMENT (the “Agreement” and/or “Terms and Conditions”), as amended from time to time by Web.com Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns (the terms “Web.com,” “us,” “we” and/or “our” shall refer to Web.com), between you (the terms “Customer,” “you” and/or “your” shall refer to the individual, entity or organization that accepts this Agreement, has access to your account or uses the Services) and Web.com, sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your purchase and/or use of our products and services (collectively, the \"Services\") as further set forth herein. You and Web.com together may be referred to herein as the “Parties” and each may be referred to herein as a “Party.” This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us in relation to any Services you purchase or otherwise utilize.\n\nYou acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by all of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, as well as all other applicable rules or policies, terms and conditions, or service agreements that are or may be established by Web.com from time to time and are incorporated herein by reference. You may also elect to purchase additional Services (the “Additional Services”) from Web.com, our partners and/or other third parties, which may have their own service agreements or other related terms and conditions, and it is your obligation to review, accept and abide by those service agreements or other related terms and conditions, as well as this Agreement.\n\nWeb.com agrees to comply in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) to the extent applicable to Web.com and to the extent Web.com is storing, processing, or transmitting any “Cardholder Data” or “Sensitive Authentication Data” (as those defined under the PCI-DSS) in connection with the Services.\n\n**2. SERVICES **\n\nThis Agreement applies to all Services, whether purchased or utilized separately or as part of a complete solution or packaged bundle. Your purchase of the Services, continued use of the Services, and/or continued access to the Services constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement. If you purchase Services that are sold together as a “bundled” package (e.g., you purchase a package that includes both a domain name and a website builder or other Services, as opposed to your purchasing such Services separately), termination of any part of the Services will result in the termination of all Web.com Services provided as part of the bundled package. See Section 4 (Termination) for additional details on this subject. Web.com further reserves the right to modify the Services, at our sole and absolute discretion, either temporarily or permanently, at any time or from time to time, with or without notice to you. You agree that Web.com shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such modification of the Services and that your continued use of the modified Services, and/or continued access to the modified Services, constitutes your acceptance of any such modifications.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that some or all of the Services you purchase or receive from us may be provided by one or more vendors, contractors or affiliates selected by Web.com in its sole and absolute discretion. As a part of your Services, Web.com may provide you access to third-party functionality or services, including, but not limited to, applications, widgets, Rich Site Summary (“RSS”), other types of news, event and industry feeds, calculators, recommended copy, forms and templates that are incorporated or offered as a part of one or more of the Services (collectively, “Third-Party Functionality”). You acknowledge and agree that your use of any Third-Party Functionality to which you are provided access as part of any Web.com Services is in accordance with the terms of any relevant third-party licenses, agreements and/or terms and conditions. Your failure to abide by any such third- party licenses, agreements and/or terms and conditions may result in the immediate termination of your Services provided by Web.com. You understand and agree that Web.com does not control such Third-Party Functionality and is therefore not liable to you or any third party for any issues of any kind relating to issues relating to Third- Party Functionality. Web.com reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate, suspend, cancel or alter your access to Third-Party Functionality at any time and without notice to you.\n\n**3. FEES AND PAYMENTS, TERM & RENEWALS **\n\nAs consideration for the Services you purchase, order or otherwise utilize, you agree to pay Web.com all applicable prices and fees as designated in the related order process, with such prices and fees subject to change as provided in this Agreement. All prices and fees are due immediately or upon ordering and are non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, as required by applicable law, or as such prices and fees are billed by Web.com under an invoice or order confirmation for Services issued to a Customer that expressly permits payment within thirty (30) days after Web.com has sent the Customer such invoice or order confirmation (\"Net-30 Customers\"). Web.com may require a Customer to successfully complete a credit application prior to such Customer qualifying to become a Net-30 Customer.\n\nIf you require Additional Services, then additional prices and fees will apply pursuant to then current rates, which are also subject to change in accordance with this Agreement. All quoted prices and fees exclude all applicable sales tax, use tax, value added tax (“VAT”), and other taxes and government charges, whether federal, state or foreign. You are responsible for payment of all such taxes (other than based on Web.com’s income), fees, duties and charges on your payment for the purchase of Services arising from any and all fees under this Agreement. Accordingly, you agree to pay all VAT, sales and other taxes (other than taxes based on Web.com income) related to Web.com services or payments made by you hereunder. All payments of prices and fees for Web.com Services shall be made in U.S. dollars. Although Web.com may display pricing in various currencies, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase. If the currency of your bank or credit card account is not in U.S. dollars, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank or credit card company. In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process; (ii) the time the transaction is processed; and\n\n(iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank or credit card, the conversion rates may fluctuate and Web.com makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank or credit card for payment will be the same amount that is posted to your bank or credit card statement or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank or credit card statement, and you agree to waive any and all claims against Web.com based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing). You acknowledge and agree that you may be charged VAT based on the country indicated in the account holder’s address information associated with your account. Set up prices and fees, if any, will become payable on the applicable effective date for the applicable Services.\n\nUnless otherwise stipulated in the related order process, payment for the Services are to be made via a charge to your credit card, charge card, PayPal account or bank account provided to us (“the Account”). You are solely and absolutely responsible for any Account information that you provide to Web.com and must promptly inform Web.com of any changes or updates to the method of payment. By submitting an order for Services, you authorize Web.com to charge the order to the Account or to otherwise immediately bill you for the Services. You acknowledge and agree that unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the order process or otherwise changed afterwards in accordance with the applicable process, all annual, monthly or other recurring fees related to the Services or otherwise referenced in this Agreement are to be recurring transactions that will be billed on an ongoing basis until the Services are terminated in accordance with this Agreement. If you have provided billing information sufficient for automatic billing, then Web.com will bill you automatically in accordance with the applicable billing frequency. You are obligated to pay for the full amount of the Agreement, even if such full amount is scheduled to be paid in installments. If you elect to pay for the Services in installments, provided such a payment schedule is expressly permitted and accepted by Web.com, all installments must be received on or before the applicable due date. If you qualify, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, extend payment terms to you under our Business Account Credit Program.\n\nUnless otherwise specified herein, on our website or in the applicable order process, each Web.com Service is for a one-year initial term and renewable thereafter for successive terms. Any Web.com Service that provides for a monthly billing cycle may be billed every four (4) weeks. Any renewal of your Services with us is subject to our then current Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, successful completion of any applicable authentication procedure, and payment of all applicable service prices and fees at the time of renewal, and in the case of domain name re-registration, the domain name registry's acceptance of your domain name registration. Upon prior notice, Web.com may also charge an “Account Maintenance Fee” to maintain your active account. This Account Maintenance Fee shall be billed to your account each year, thirty (30) days following the annual anniversary date of your account creation. Except with respect to the Services to which you subscribe on a monthly (or similar billing cycle) basis, we will endeavor, but are not obligated, to provide you with notice prior to the renewal of your Services at least fifteen (15) days prior to the renewal date.\n\nPricing for Services, renewals, and product upgrades and add-ons may vary based upon the date of your purchase. Additional payment terms may apply to the Services you purchase, as set forth in the applicable supplemental service and product agreements to this Agreement, on our website or as otherwise outlined in the applicable order process. Services to which you subscribe to on a monthly or recurring basis automatically renew on a recurring basis until the Agreement is properly terminated in accordance with its terms. We may, at any time, activate the auto-renew service for eligible Services in your account if it is not already activated. Further, we may provide you with an opportunity to opt-in to our automatic renewal process in accordance with the instructions (and subject to your agreement to the terms and conditions pertaining to that process) on our website or in the applicable order process. You agree that if you are enrolled in or otherwise utilizing our auto-renew service, we will attempt to renew your service at some point less than ninety (90) days prior to its expiration [without notice to you]. Such automatic renewal for your Services, if successful, may be for a shorter term than the term for which you originally purchased your Services, but in no event shall such term be longer than the term then currently in place for the Services. Such automatic renewal for your Services, if successful, shall be at the then current price for the Services. You further agree that, to turn off the auto-renew service for any of your Services with Web.com, you must call our Customer Service, or you may be able to turn off such auto-renew service utilizing the online Account Manager associated with your Services. You acknowledge and agree that the renewal price may be higher or lower than the price you paid for the then current term of the Services, and that we are authorized to charge your credit card or other payment method on file for the renewal of the Services. In any event, you are solely and absolutely responsible for the credit card or payment information you provide to Web.com and must promptly inform Web.com of any changes thereto (e.g., change of expiration date or account number). You acknowledge and agree that Web.com may extend the expiration date on your credit card on file with us in order to protect against unwanted expiration of your Services and to allow for the automatic renewal thereof. In addition, you are solely and absolutely responsible for ensuring the Services are renewed. Web.com shall have no liability to you or any third party in connection with the renewal as described herein, including, but not limited to, any failure or errors in renewing the Services whether due to you, us or a third party. In order to process a renewal under our auto-renew service, we may use third-party vendors for the purpose of updating the expiration date and account number of your credit card or other payment method on file. Such third-party vendors maintain relationships with various credit card issuers and may be able to provide us with the updated expiration date and account number for your credit card by comparing the information we have on file with the information the third-party vendor has on file. By selecting our auto-renew service, you acknowledge and agree that we may share your credit card or other payment method information with such third-party vendors for the purpose of obtaining any update to your credit card expiration date, account number or payment account.\n\nIn the event that you are not enrolled in auto-renew, or have opted out of auto-renew, and want to renew your Services, you acknowledge and agree you are responsible for actively renewing your Services and you further assume all risk and consequences if you wait until the end of the Services term or otherwise to attempt to renew any Services. If any Service is not successfully renewed prior to the expiration of its then current term, all your rights to such Service will terminate, and we will have no obligation to allow you to renew a Service once its expiration date has passed. Additionally, for domain name registration services, even if a registry administrator or third-party service provider provides a grace period to Web.com upon expiration or termination of such Service, you acknowledge and agree that any post-expiration renewal or redemption processes implemented on your behalf are at our sole and absolute discretion, and may be subject to a late fee, reinstatement fee, redemption fee and/or other fee.\n\nWithout limiting any of Web.com's rights hereunder, should any fee payment become delinquent, Web.com may suspend or cancel your Services; provided, however, related charges will continue to accrue. You acknowledge and agree that Web.com is not responsible whatsoever for any effect the suspension of Services might have. If Web.com provides any Service discount to you and you default on payments or obligations as outlined herein, Web.com may rescind all discounts and require full payment for the Services. All sums due and payable that remain unpaid after any applicable cure period herein will accrue interest as a late charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less. Web.com further reserves the right to refer any amounts owed hereunder to a third party for collection in the event of default. In the event your account is sent to collection, you agree to pay all costs of collection, including costs, litigation and attorneys’ fees. A $20.00 (Twenty U.S. dollars) collection fee may be charged for all dishonored checks. Moreover, an additional fee may also be assessed for the following reasons: (i) late payment; (ii) payment with insufficient funds; (iii) denied or invalid credit card number; or (iv) the re-starting or reinstating of Services terminated for nonpayment. Web.com will re-start or reinstate any such Service in our sole and absolute discretion and subject to our receipt of the applicable service fee, renewal fee or other fee.\n\nIf Customer pays for the Services by credit card or charge card, Customer permanently and irrevocably waives any and all right to enact a ‘chargeback' (that is, a disputed, reversed or contested charge with the applicable bank, credit card, charge card or other payment method) against these payments for any reason whatsoever against Web.com. If for any reason Web.com is unable to charge your Account or other payment method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Web.com receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Account or other payment method, you agree that we may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including, but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any your Services (including domain names). We also reserve the right to charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing fees” for (i) additional tasks we may perform outside the normal scope of the Services; (ii) additional time and/or costs we may incur in providing the Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to: (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by Web.com staff or by outside firms retained by us; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Web.com as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or other payment method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Account or other payment method you have on file with Web.com.\n\nCUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT ALL WEB.COM FEES AND CHARGES ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THAT WEB.COM MAY CHANGE ANY PRICE, FEE, RATE OR PLAN AT ANY TIME UPON NOTICE TO CUSTOMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 26 (NOTICE) OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n**4. TERMINATION **\n\n**A.** **Generally.** Web.com may terminate this Agreement immediately for any or no reason and without notice to you. Without limiting the foregoing, Web.com reserves the right to suspend or terminate all Services immediately without notice to you if Web.com determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that you have failed to comply with your obligations as set forth in this Agreement. In the event of your chargeback by a credit card, charge card or other payment method, or other non-payment by you in connection with your payments of the applicable billing cycle fee, renewal fee or other applicable fee, you acknowledge and agree that all of your Services may be suspended, canceled or terminated, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice to you.\n\nUnless otherwise stipulated in the related order process, you may terminate this Agreement and the Services by calling Web.com Customer Service, whereby this termination request may be recorded, and the Services will terminate as of the end of the applicable, current billing period. You are responsible for all fees incurred up to and including the date of termination and upon termination you may receive a final bill reflecting the balance due for any remaining charges and agrees to pay all such fees incurred by you and/or via your utilization of the Services. If you order any Services by telephone and do not agree to be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions at that time, you must notify Web.com within seventy-two (72) hours from the time that Web.com has sent you a welcome e-mail to your account e-mail address on record, that you desire to cancel such Services, whereby the Services will be cancelled, and a refund of any payments or fees already paid to Web.com with respect to the order of the Services will be issued, with no further obligation by either Party. Your failure to notify Web.com of cancellation of any Services as described above will indicate that you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood these Terms and Conditions and agree to be legally bound by them.\n\nExcept as otherwise expressly set forth herein or on our website, Web.com will cease charging your credit card, if applicable, for any monthly service fees as of the expiration of the billing cycle in which the termination is effective. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Web.com, you will not receive any refund for payments already made by you as of the date of termination, regardless of whether any related Services have been performed, and you may also incur additional fees and/or be obligated to pay us for the balance of your term (in the case of a monthly or annual subscription being paid over time, as provided in various supplemental service and product agreements). If termination of this Agreement is due to your default hereunder, you shall bear all costs of such termination, including any reasonable costs Web.com incurs in closing your account and you further agree to pay any and all costs incurred by Web.com in enforcing your compliance with this Section. Upon termination, you must destroy any copy of the materials licensed to you hereunder and referenced herein. You agree that upon termination or discontinuance for any reason, we may delete all information related to you on the Service, if applicable. In addition to the terms set forth herein, certain Web.com Services may have additional terms regarding termination, which are set forth in the applicable supplemental service and/or product agreements. Moreover, should you or we cancel or terminate your Services at any time prior to the completion of the applicable term, such cancellation or termination may result in our application of an early termination fee charged to your account, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice to you.\n\n**B. Termination of Bundled Services.** In addition to the Terms and Conditions set forth herein, if you purchase Web.com Services which are sold together as a solution or bundled package of Services, any termination relating to any one such solution or bundled package will terminate all Web.com Services included in such solution or bundled package. For instance, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any domain name registered with or maintained by Web.com under this Agreement (but not including any domain names you may have registered, either with Web.com or a third-party registrar, separately and not as part of a bundled package) may be cancelled and may thereafter be available for registration by another party. You acknowledge and agree that upon any termination or cancellation of your solution or bundled package, the Terms and Conditions regarding transfer of expired domain names as described in this Service Agreement may apply. Upon the effective date of termination, Web.com will no longer provide the solution or bundled package to you, any licenses granted to you will immediately terminate, and you must cease using such Services immediately; provided, however, that we may, in our sole and absolute discretion and subject to your agreement to be bound by the applicable agreements and to pay the applicable fees, allow you to convert certain Services included in the bundled Services to stand-alone Services.\n\n**C. Free Services. **Web.com may, from time to time and at our sole and absolute discretion, offer free e-mail, website hosting or other Services to our customers. Customers are required to use these Services regularly to keep the accounts active, and Web.com reserves the right to terminate free accounts that remain idle for a period of thirty (30) days or more. Free Services may not be provisioned until such time as the Customer configures the account and logs in for the first time. It is your sole responsibility to keep your free Service in active status by regularly logging into your account.\n\n**5. OWNERSHIP **\n\n**A. Generally.** Except as otherwise set forth herein, all right, title and interest in and to: (i) all registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and logos; (ii) all patents, patent applications and patentable ideas, inventions and/or improvements; (iii) all trade secrets, proprietary information and know-how; (iv) all divisions, continuations, reissues, renewals and extensions thereof now existing or hereafter filed, issued or acquired; (v) all registered and unregistered copyrights including, but not limited to, any forms, images, audiovisual displays, text and software; and (vi) all other intellectual property, proprietary rights or other rights related to intangible property which are used, developed, comprising, embodied in or practiced in connection with any of the Web.com Services identified herein (collectively, \"Web.com Intellectual Property Rights\") are owned by Web.com or its licensors, and you agree to make no claim of interest in or ownership of any such Web.com Intellectual Property Rights.

The Images are either owned by Web.com or licensed from a third party. Unless otherwise stipulated by Web.com, your use of the Images is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement. Provided you are not in breach of this Agreement or any of the representations and warranties contained herein, and provided you have paid the applicable fees, you may perform the following actions subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section (upon termination of the Services or this Agreement all of your rights and licenses in and to the Images will immediately terminate):\n\ni. incorporate the Images into your own original work and publish, display and distribute your work on the Website. You may not, however, resell, sublicense or otherwise make available the Images for use or distribution separately or detached from a product or webpage. For example, the Images may be used as part of a webpage design, but may not be made available for downloading separately or in a format designed or intended for permanent storage or re-use by others. Similarly, you may be provided with copies of the Images (including digital files) as part of work product, but you are not permitted to use the Images separately or as part of any other product;\n\nii. back up, copy, or archive the Images as necessary for internal use, and only as necessary for that use. Any copy or archive you make must include the Image's copyright information; and\n\niii. in the normal course of workflow, convey to a third party (such as a printer) temporary copies of the Images that are integral to your work product and without which the product could not be completed.\n\nWith respect to the use of any Images, you may not:\n\ni. create scandalous, obscene, defamatory or immoral works using the Images, nor use the Images for any other purpose which is prohibited by law;\n\nii. use the Images or any part of it as part of a trademark, service mark or logo. Web.com and those third parties from whom they have licensed images retain the full rights to the Images, and therefore you cannot establish their own rights over any part of the Images;\n\niii. remove any copyright or trademark from any place where it appears on the Images or its accompanying materials;\n\niv. rent, lease, sublicense or lend the Images, or a copy thereof, to another person or legal entity without the express written consent of Web.com;\n\nv. transfer the rights to the Images, accompanying materials or storage media for the Images, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.

Doing so will be viewed as an attempt to distribute the Images in violation of this Agreement;\n\nix. re-sell, distribute or sub-license the Images, storage media for the Images, or the rights to use the Images to anyone for any purpose, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement; or\n\nx. use the Images in any way that could be considered defamatory, libelous, pornographic, immoral, obscene or fraudulent, either by making physical changes to the Images or in the juxtaposition of the Images to accompanying text. You agree not to use Images as part of any use involving sensitive subject matter, as determined by Web.com in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, the following sensitive subjects: all sexual issues, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, alcohol, tobacco, cancer, mental ailments, alternative lifestyle issues and physical or mental abuse, without advance written consent from Web.com and any model in such Image.

You agree to comply with such applicable laws and regulations and to indemnify and hold Web.com harmless from any damages it may suffer resulting from any violation of the export control laws of the United States.\n\n**14. WAIVER **\n\nNo waiver of any provision of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Web.com. Web.com’s remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative, and the election of one remedy for a breach does not preclude pursuit of other remedies. The failure of Web.com to require your performance of any Agreement provision does not affect the full right to require such performance at any time in the future. The waiver by Web.com of any rights arising out of any breach of any Agreement provision shall not be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. Any failure by Web.com to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement or any applicable laws does not constitute a waiver of such right.\n\nNeither Party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than (i) by an authorized representative and (ii) in an explicit written waiver. No waiver of any rights arising out of a breach of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of rights relating to any prior or subsequent breach of this Agreement.\n\n**15. SEVERABILITY **\n\nYou agree that the terms of this Agreement are severable. If any term or provision is declared invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, that term or provision will not affect the remainder of this Agreement. This Agreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make this Agreement enforceable, valid and, to the maximum extent possible, consistent with applicable law and consistent with the original intention of the Parties; and the remaining terms and provisions will remain in full force and effect.\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, Web.com will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of Web.com as reflected in the original provision. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement does not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect.\n\n**16. FORCE MAJEURE **\n\nNeither Party is deemed in default hereunder, nor will it hold the other Party responsible for, any cessation, interruption or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement due to earthquake, flood, fire, storm, natural disaster, act of God, war, terrorism, armed conflict, labor strike, lockout or boycott, provided that the Party relying upon this Section takes all steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances to mitigate the effects of the force majeure event upon which such notice is based; provided further, that in the event a force majeure event described in this Section extends for a period in excess of thirty (30) days in the aggregate, Web.com may immediately terminate this Agreement and will have no liability therefrom.\n\n**17.

In addition, you are not, nor is Customer acting on behalf of, any person or entity that is a Specially Designated National (\"SDN\"), as OFAC may so designate from time to time.

And with so many location-sharing apps around, the Verizon Family app provides something extra: peace of mind. With Verizon Family, you can see your child’s location, even when the GPS setting is turned off on their phone, providing an extra layer of visibility to help you stay connected.**\n\n## Easy set up, too.\n\nHere’s how it works: Set up profiles through the app, designating roles.\n\n- Guardian—the primary account holder\n- Dependent—your kids\n- Member—trusted friends, extended family and loved ones who enable the GPS settings on their phones\n\nOnce linked, everyone’s location can be viewed from a single dashboard—no frantic texting required.\n\n## Text less. Know more.\n\nStill wondering how the Verizon Family app might actually make your family gatherings less stressful? Picture this:\n\n**Did they leave for the airport?**Want to know if your college freshman left for the airport without them fumbling for their phone to text you? Instead of texting, check the app’s dashboard for their location.**Meet them at the door:**Set up a geofence—a virtual boundary around your home or gathering spot—and get an alert when Aunt Jenny’s car pulls into your neighborhood. That way, you can greet her at the door instead of frantically checking your texts.**Safe Walk, all the way home:**For kids walking home after a party or grandparents navigating dark roads at night, the app’s Safe Walk feature tracks their route in real time, and they’ll know you’re keeping a virtual eye on them. You’ll also know when they’ve arrived safely without needing to send a dozen “Are you there yet?” texts.\n\n## How to start sharing locations with the Verizon Family app\n\nDownload Verizon Family to your phone and invite family members. Dependents install the Verizon Family Companion app, while others use the main Verizon Family app. Within minutes, everyone’s connected.\n\nYou can set screen time limits or content filters for your Dependents by upgrading to Verizon Family Plus.\n\n## Texts, calls, location—covered\n\nStudies show that today’s families can spend anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week managing their schedules. But there’s a smarter way to save time, share locations and more—with Verizon Family.\n\n**Verizon postpaid mobile plans include Verizon Family location sharing features at no add’l cost. Verizon Family app download req’d; iOS and Android devices only. Data rates apply.*\n\n***If GPS location is turned off, Verizon Family provides estimated location from the wireless network for Verizon devices. Network location is less precise than GPS-based location.*\n\nMeg St-Esprit, M.Ed., is a journalist who writes about education, parenting, tech and travel.

To optimize the digital experience for all of our customers, we strive to meet the online accessibility standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA. We take a number of steps to attempt to meet or exceed those standards while also providing critical support for global initiatives like the Valuable 500 and Ability Beyond which customizes low cost devices so their clients with disabilities can communicate and thrive.*\n\nJay, as he’ll be referred to here, and his family never thought a tablet could change their lives. Jay was born without a corpus callosum, a broad band of nerves that connect the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Even before Jay was born, his parents knew their son could have difficulty with a range of abilities, from walking to talking.\n\nToday, at age 4, Jay is developing typically in many ways. But when I started working with Jay as a speech therapist who specializes in using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to help kids communicate, he was non-speaking. Now, Jay is interacting with his siblings, his peers and his parents using a tablet and a specialized communication app that’s helping him express his every thought.\n\nJay is one among over 2 million Americans who use AAC to communicate, according to the American Speech Language and Hearing Association (ASHA). For parents and kids like Jay, AAC technology can be as accessible as downloading an app. But ease of use and access isn’t all that’s important. While AAC devices are more effective, three out of five AAC apps and devices can be abandoned or forgotten after a year because caregivers struggle to make them work. So, when it comes to helping kids in need use tools to express themselves, a little understanding about this technology can go a long way.\n\nThis parent’s guide is ideal for those who are just learning what AAC technologies are and how they can help children better express themselves.\n\n## What is AAC?\n\nAAC is any means of communication other than spoken words. It could be a gesture, such as a thumbs up from across the room, or a wave hello. No-tech and low-tech AAC includes written words, sign language and even drawings. High-tech AAC—which we’ll focus on for this article—includes anything that is technology based, such as a computer or tablet with an app that can provide a speech output.\n\nThese devices are also known as speech generating devices, or SGD. That’s just a fancy way of saying “it talks for you.” For example, Elizabeth Bonkers, a non-verbal college graduate, recently gave a commencement speech using such a device. You can watch her speech here.\n\nAAC can be used by a variety of kids with a range of abilities. With the advent of AAC applications for smartphones and tablets, they’re more widely available than ever. Most of these new apps are highly customizable so that each child’s needs are met on an individualized basis.\n\n## How high-tech AAC helps kids communicate\n\nLong before tablets and apps, AAC devices were paper pages bound in three-ring binders, or they were the size of small computers. Usability was limited to pointing to images or pushing buttons with images, and if there was a voice output, it was mechanical and robotic sounding by modern standards.\n\nToday the technology has gone high-tech. There are AAC apps for tablets and smartphones, and there are standalone devices designed specifically for AAC and preloaded with communication software.\n\nSpeech output voices are natural and personalized, and these devices can be accessed with direct touch, eye gaze, keyboards and even electromyography-based controls, which means the device can be accessed by the measurement of electrical activity associated with the activation of a muscle group using a small, wearable piece of tech that interfaces with the device.\n\nWith these high-tech changes, AAC is now accessible to people in ways that it wasn’t 20 years ago. And the cost is often partially covered by insurance, but it depends on the policy.\n\n## Benefits of high-tech AAC technology for kids\n\nHere are six benefits of going high tech.\n\n**Robust vocabulary:**High-tech AAC options give children faster access to more vocabulary words. Low-tech options are limited to what can be printed out on a page. For example, if you go out to a restaurant, you’re limited to ordering what you see printed on the menu versus asking for what you really want. Which could be limiting in a situation where communication needs to be more spontaneous, or improvisational.**Adapts with a child’s developmental progress:**Apps such as Proloquo2go, a communication tool for iOS devices, are designed to adapt as your child advances. For example, you might start with 15 to 20 vocabulary words per screen on the tablet or device, and as the child grows, you can easily add more words.**Better auditory feedback:**Some children have difficulty decoding various parts of verbal communication. For example, one speaker may hear and understand the phrase, “I want the ball.” For those high on the autism spectrum, for example, tiny changes or fluctuations in the speaker’s tone or facial expression could make the phrase mean something different. The consistent message output from a high-tech app or device means the user can experience the message the same way each time it’s produced, making it easier to decode, and then easier to repeat. Research also shows that some children are eventually able to verbally repeat phrases from these devices.**Multiple language options:**Many apps and devices offer multiple languages. This is ideal for children who live in bilingual homes. High-tech AAC options make it easy to toggle back and forth between different languages with relative ease.**Communicating with larger groups:**With low-tech options, children are often only able to communicate with people who can see their AAC board or display. If the child is communicating, but no one sees them doing so, the message could go unrecognized. The voice output from high-tech apps and devices lets anyone nearby hear the user.**Internet access:**Many apps and devices offer options to turn messages into social media posts, emails and more. This is an essential part of being an adolescent in today’s world, and not available when using low tech.\n\n## Things to know when choosing high-tech AAC apps and devices\n\nBefore choosing an AAC app or device, whether high or low tech, make sure to talk to a speech language pathologist. Making the decision is a long, complicated process that should be completed with a speech language pathologist and an augmentative communication team. This short list can help you get started in your search.\n\n**Not every app or device is the same.** Some tablets may have limited access to features such as social media or email. Some have monthly subscriptions. Some may not be covered by insurance, so it’s important to work with your insurance company and speech pathologist.\n\n**Not all AAC apps and devices are created equal.** Some use different symbols than others. Some are very complicated to program. Also in my experience, the less expensive apps don’t work as well. They may be glitchy, or have a lot of pop-up ads. Seek the opinion of a speech language pathologist, and remember, the people who try to sell these devices are trying to sell them. I’ve had experiences where families have talked with a salesperson before a speech therapist. It’s important to ensure that your therapist’s recommendation comes first.\n\n**Not every app is available on every tablet.** Some apps are only available on iOS devices, and others are available on multiple platforms. This is essential information if you have multiple products you plan to use at your house. For example, you might purchase an app on your phone, only to realize later it can’t be used on your tablet.\n\n## How to choose the right AAC app or device for your child\n\nIt’s important to note that not all speech therapists have experience with high-tech AAC technology. Ask if they do use them and how long they have worked with kids who use AAC.\n\nHere are some tips for choosing the right AAC technology for your child:\n\n**Define your child’s communication needs.** What are their communication goals? What do they want to be able to communicate? Who do they talk to? Where will they need to have access to their app or device?\n\n**Consider your child’s physical abilities.** While there are no prerequisites to using AAC, there are some medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, that will need a team approach. There are AAC apps and devices designed for different age groups and abilities and your speech pathologist will know what’s best for your family.\n\n**Try different devices and apps.** Many companies offer free trial periods for their device, and many speech language therapists have access to these apps and devices as well. Obtaining a device can feel like an urgent matter, but picking the wrong device can lead to device abandonment.\n\n**Check parental lock options on the tablet.** Not all tablets have this feature. Parental locks are essential, especially for devices that are used by younger children. For example, if your non-verbal child is already using a tablet to watch videos or play games, he or she may be more inclined to keep using it for entertainment, not therapy. So, you want to lock down anything on that device that could distract them from using it as a therapy tool.\n\n**Check screen light options.** Some iOS devices allow you to turn off the blue light from screens, which studies are showing could have a negative neurological impact.\n\n**Get a protective case and buy a protection plan if you can.** Devices will get dropped, spilled on and more. Be prepared.\n\nIf the AAC team can find the right app or device for your child, it’s possible to unlock their world in ways you can’t imagine. Like Jay, your child may grow more confident and engaged with their world. Not only is Jay expressing his wants and desires, but he’s using his device to learn new concepts and interact in social situations.\n\nRecently, using his device, Jay was able to tell his parents, “I love you,” a powerful phrase that’s been in him for some time, and just needed a little high-tech help to express.\n\nWith Smart Family, you can protect your kids and keep an eye on their activity online with one easy app.",

      "content": "# Internet safety for kids making friends online\n\n## What’s the right response when you see your child online talking to someone you don’t know?\n\n\nIn a recent study that Magid conducted for the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), parents identified the ability to control who can directly contact their child as their most desired social media safety tool. Parents concerns for their children’s safety and well-being while engaging with others online are legitimate. Balancing the needs of young people to connect online—including with those they don’t know in real life—with their safety is challenging.\n\nThe key to ensuring that kids are making friends online safely with social media and video chat apps begins with trust. The tips and strategies below will help parents establish trust and encourage healthy and safe online practices in kids.\n\n## Why are kids making friends online?\n\nMaintaining a sense of connection during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for many kids. Access to peer groups—even dating online—requires more effort with limited in-person schooling and extracurricular activity. This has led many teens to increase online engagement with others. Recognizing positive online social connections for kids is an important part of understanding the lives of today’s children. Here are three important positive factors related to online social connections for kids:\n\n**Most of today’s most popular apps with kids have a social component.**Roblox, Minecraft and Twitch are examples of gaming platforms that have provided a surrogate way of making friends online when in-person interaction is not an option.**Online resources can provide specific support.**Parents may be understandably concerned about how kids are meeting online, but there are sites and apps specific to certain issues that are safer and more supportive than many parents may realize. For example, TrevorSpace provides affirmative support for LGBTQ youth. It has earned its reputation as a trusted online space due to robust community guidelines, safeguards such as abuse reporting, profile management tools and community moderation. Many similar communities exist around a variety of issues.**There’s a shortage of mental health resources.**Support can be especially critical considering that only about half of all 8- to 15-year-olds experiencing depressive symptoms are getting any form of professional mental health treatment. Virtual friendships and support groups shouldn’t be dismissed simply for their online origins.\n\n## Strategies for talking to your kids\n\nThe importance of connection and making friends online may not alleviate concerns about children’s online interactions. This makes safe social media an important topic of conversation for parents to have with kids. A conversation will let parents express themselves while also being supportive of kids. This will establish healthy online behavior and open the door to future sharing about online engagement. Here are two ways to start the conversation:\n\n**Initiate these discussions early.**Likeable Media CEO Carrie Kerpen speaks eloquently on this as “shaping the narrative” in a blog post about making friends online. “When you start kids young on social media, kids are more open to learn,” says her daughter Liv, who was 11 at the time. “If I had waited, I wouldn’t be as willing to listen to my mom. You can help shape their narrative.”**Encourage openness with your kids about their online interactions.**Taking an interest in kids’ online lives will help develop this. Discussing internet safety relating to current events or incidents that may have happened in school or your community can also provide important social media context. Positive examples of solutions that resolved these incidents help equip kids to deal with persistent online risks like bullying. These conversations are an investment in encouraging openness with your kids about their online interaction.\n\n## Use digital control tools to control what you can.\n\nKnowing the digital tools available to manage online engagement is important.\n\nLearn how to use the privacy settings in social media apps.\n\nExplore parental controls in Just Kids. The internet parental controls with Verizon’s Just Kids plan includes time restrictions and additional internet parental controls for free.\n\nAsk your kids how they protect their privacy when using their favorite apps. It may surprise you to know that many kids know about and use tools available to them to block problematic users and ensure privacy in their online social lives.\n\n\n## Know the warning signs.\n\nKnowing common warning signs can help parents identify potential situations that may involve unhealthy or potentially dangerous online interactions. Some examples of behavior that, especially when combined, could indicate concern:\n\nLong hours spent online\n\nSecretive behavior, like hiding a phone or laptop when parents enter the room\n\nUnexpected arrival of physical gifts from someone unknown to the parents\n\nWithdrawal from family life\n\n\nHaving this foundational knowledge about making your kids making friends online should help parents rest easier. In a world where kids are increasingly seeking connection online, it’s important to be supportive, communicative and understanding before diagnosing your child’s online behavior as an immediate problem.\n\nWhen your kids are making friends online, put more internet parental controls into play today with Verizon’s Just Kids, which offers more ways to control usage, access and internet safety for kids in one app.",

      "content": "# Parents who bully: tips and strategies for how to respond\n\nIt isn’t only kids that engage in bullying and exclusion on social media. Sometimes, parents do too, especially if their child is involved in a bullying situation at school, there are “parent cliques” and the adults start taking sides.\n\nThis is one of the fastest growing bullying trends in our culture and one that as an anti-bullying expert I’m asked about daily. What many of these parents don’t realize is the damage their actions cause. They’re also setting a troubling precedent for their children.\n\n## In the age of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has created an even higher reliance on digital platforms to communicate. This comes with both advantages and challenges. Some bad behaviors like parents that bully online may escalate, especially during this stressful time, when the entire world is on edge.\n\nHow do you respond to a bullying parent online in a way that inspires dignity, understanding, and motivates everyone to work in partnership with each other? As a parent, how do you set an example of the person you want your child to be when they’re being bullied?\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\n- If you’re being harassed by another parent, it’s usually fear that’s motivating it. In most bullying situations, whether among children or adults, the bully is acting out in a cry for help. Perhaps that parent is going through a bitter divorce, financial hardship, or family crisis. Whatever their situation may be, if you can keep that in mind, it may help you find some compassion despite your anger, which will give you more control over any impulse to lash out.\n- There’s a difference between reacting and responding. Reacting is when you say or do something in the moment of heated emotion without thinking it through. Responding is when you stop, process, and then act with intention. Ask yourself these questions: What outcome do I want from my response and why? What words/actions are most likely to inspire that outcome? Am I being fair, truthful and compassionate? Be as specific as possible, consider each answer carefully and be guided accordingly.\n- Don’t engage the other parent publicly on-line as this is only likely to escalate the issue. Instead, message them privately, acknowledge that you hear how upset they are, and suggest talking things through over the phone or in person (if appropriate). When you do have that conversation, don’t interrupt or become defensive. Listen and then share your honest thoughts. Often, just letting the other parent talk and know that they’re being heard will dissipate enough of the tension to allow for a productive dialogue.\n- Emotional Credibility in Communication means that you engender trust. There are three tenets of Emotional Credibility in Communication that are helpful when dealing with a bullying parent or anyone whose trust you wish to inspire. Specificity: the more specific you are when you communicate, the more validated the other person feels; the more general you are, the more dismissed they feel. Immediacy: when someone is upset, address it in as timely a manner as possible and don’t let them fester. Semantics and Positioning: present it the way you want it perceived; if you want something perceived as positive, introduce it that way.\n\nPatience, understanding, empathy and dignity are not qualities that you can discipline into a child or even teach in a classroom. They must be inspired by example. Use this precious time right now to be that inspiration for your children online and everywhere.\n\n**Learn about Verizon's response to COVID-19.**",

      "content": "# Balancing trust and safety: How parents can monitor their teen’s digital activity\n\n## Too much restriction can have a negative effect, studies show. Strive for a mix of supervision, guidance and nonintervention.\n\n\nToday’s digital parents are learning to walk a tricky line: give their teens privacy and freedom to express themselves while also protecting them from the potential dangers of the internet. Many parents feel it’s important to monitor or limit their child’s internet behavior—from browsing to social media—until they reach a certain level of maturity or media literacy. In 2018, 58% of parents in a Pew Research Center survey said they looked through a teen’s calls or text messages. That’s up from 48% percent in 2016.\n\nWith devices so prevalent in teens’ everyday lives, researchers have identified new ways to keep teenagers safe while preserving room to explore and learn.\n\n#### Not everything happens on Facebook.\n\nThe potential for unmonitored and unlimited interactions can make it difficult for parents to screen what their teens see. Even if parents take steps to limit their child’s browsing capabilities, inappropriate apps and websites can still be accessed with a friend.\n\nBut, understanding the nuances and potential dangers of popular apps and platforms can help build a sensible monitoring strategy. Service provider or third-party tracking programs and apps, such as WebWatcher, allow parents to monitor and catalog what teens are viewing.\n\nAnd while Instagram, Facebook and Twitter are everywhere, it’s important that parents have some familiarity with the other apps teens are using. Common Sense Media flags GroupMe, Kik Messenger and WhatsApp as other potentially dangerous online spaces because they allow teens to hide conversations and talk to older teens or users over the age of 16. The lesson? Media literacy is as important for parents as it is for teens.\n\nParents can micromanage their child’s accounts and internet usage, but that may set up an environment of resistance and distrust.\n\n- Raychelle Lohmann author of *The Bullying Workbook for Teens*\n\n#### Proactively tracking and limiting access\n\nNeary six in ten parents (58%) monitor their teen’s web behavior or look through their phones, according to the Pew Research Center. But only 52% of parents use parental controls to restrict access.\n\nMonitoring a teen’s online life may give parents peace of mind, but it is by no means a silver bullet. Research from Dr. Gustavo Mesch, a professor of sociology and the rector of the University of Haifa and a specialist in teen interactions with the internet, suggests that parents who tightly monitor their children in an attempt to minimize unsafe online behavior may actually achieve the opposite effect. His study found this lack of freedom can drive teens to hide risky behaviors.\n\nDr. Mesch asked parents to try three different strategies for monitoring browsing habits: supervision, guidance and nonintervention (i.e., taking a hands-off approach). When surveyed parents actively and judiciously monitored browsing behavior and put stringent restrictions in place, teens were more likely to “engage in risky online behavior.”\n\n#### Teens know the loopholes.\n\n“Many teens are more tech savvy than their parents,” says Raychelle Lohmann, a counselor focused on teen behavior and cyber habits, and author of “The Bullying Workbook for Teens.” Some of the tools at teens’ disposal, which parents may not fully grasp, are “online privacy settings, disabling cookies [and] clearing browsing history,” Lohmann says. Teens generally can find a way to access the content they want, and the more pressure parents put on them, the more likely they are to try and hide their behavior.\n\n“Parents can micromanage their child’s accounts and internet usage, but that may set up an environment of resistance and distrust,” Lohmann says.\n\nThe breakneck pace of technology also can put savvy teens one step ahead of monitoring apps. Lohmann notes that teens can set up “smoke screens” or install apps designed to hide objectionable behaviors from parents.\n\nSome parents may feel it’s best to limit which devices their teens can use or only allow access when they reach a certain age. Lohmann suggests using age as a milestone for when parents can remove the digital training wheels, unless the parent suspects an older teen of “engaging in harmful behavior.” Though there are no hard and fast rules or maturity milestones, Lohmann recommends common sense—and common decency. “Monitoring a 13-year-old would look different from monitoring a 17-year-old,” she says.\n\n#### Bridging the gap between safety and freedom.\n\nAside from checking browser history, parents can set up a fair system for how teens use their devices and how to best monitor their behavior while maintaining a sense of freedom. Lohmann suggests putting it in writing.\n\nThink of it this way: It’s all about training a teen to navigate the internet safely, smartly and with a certain level of skepticism. Every teen is unique and requires a different approach. There is no perfect or exact age to set a teen free. Rather, it’s about gradually granting more freedom as it is earned.\n\n“Just as parents wouldn’t toss their teens the keys to the car without any background knowledge of how to operate the vehicle,” Lohmann says, “they shouldn’t toss them a device without any knowledge about how to properly use it.”\n\n“An acceptable electronic usage contract is a great way to document expectations,” she says. “Parents need to establish clear expectations, set the rules and stick to them.”\n\nAs your teen matures and gains a higher level of media literacy, they should be granted access to new sites, apps and responsibilities. It should be gradual, and it will differ for each teen. “I believe in treating teens with respect,” Lohmann says.\n\nAnd a word of encouragement: You’re doing a good job at helping your teens stay safe. Roughly six in ten teens (59%) say parents are doing an excellent or good job at addressing cyberbullying, according to the Pew Research Center survey.\n\nFor more information, check out these articles and resources on how to be a good digital parent.\n\nFor related media inquiries, please contact story.inquiry@one.verizon.com",

      "content": "# How to guide your child’s online reputation\n\n## A researcher who studies the intersection of families, technology use and privacy shares her tips on how to help kids protect their online reputation.\n\n\nWe’ve written about the importance of helping kids manage their digital footprints—the information about them scattered across the web and apps. Collectively, this information constitutes their digital identity, or the way they are represented online. And this in turn shapes their reputation.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll show you how to help your kids pay attention to this and shepherd their digital identity.\n\n## What is an online reputation?\n\nThink of identity and reputation as two sides of a coin. Your identity is how you see yourself, while your reputation is how others perceive you. Naturally, most of us want other people to think positively of us—but ultimately, you can’t control what people think about you. What we can do is recognize the kind of information that’s available about us online and consider how people might interpret it. Google yourself. What comes up? Does it reflect the way you want to be seen?\n\nChildren now use digital devices at very young ages, and well-meaning family members may share photos of your kids on social media. Which means that little ones might have digital footprints even before they can walk. Far more than in the past, this generation of children has information available about them online.\n\n## How to teach kids about managing their online reputation\n\nYou can’t control your child’s reputation any more than you can control your own, but you can help them navigate the process of identity development by encouraging them to reflect on the connections between their online activities and their reputation.\n\nA term often used in this conversation is “managing” or “guarding” your online reputation. But I’d like to propose a different word: shepherding. A shepherd is someone who protects but also guides, not by forcing others to do their bidding but by nudging them in the appropriate direction. By shepherding your child’s online activities that create their digital footprint, you’re helping them learn how to make positive choices when it comes to interacting online.\n\nYou and they likely have different reasons for caring about online reputations. You may be focused on how your child’s digital reputation will affect their ability to get into a good school or get a job, while your child probably cares more about how their reputation affects their friendships. Learning how to build healthy relationships is one of the most important processes of childhood, so focusing on their reputation with friends and classmates will help keep them tuned in to your advice.\n\nHere are some age-specific tips for shepherding your child’s digital reputation.\n\n## Ages 3–8\n\nAt this stage, children are starting to understand who they are as individuals and how to connect with peers. They’re using tablets, smartphones, gaming devices and voice-activated assistants to watch videos, play games, listen to music and ask for information. As more child-focused digital devices, like internet-connected toys and smartwatches, hit the market, young children’s online interactions will increase.\n\nThe concept of a reputation is still fairly abstract for young children, so your role here is to stay aware of what your children are doing online and to look for moments when you can help them consider how others might respond to the things they do or say online.\n\n**Use something other than their names for usernames.** Since our reputations are strongly tied to our names, avoid using your child’s first or last name when setting up any online accounts for them. Encourage your child to use generic information if they have to create their own accounts. This can minimize the chance that their early digital interactions—whether silly or misguided—get permanently attached to their digital identity.\n\n**Lead with curiosity, not criticism.** When your child does something that might reflect poorly on them, such as posting a mean or rude comment, help them understand why such actions are problematic. Approach these conversations from a position of curiosity—aiming to understand what drove them to engage in the behavior—rather than judgment. Mistakes are not only inevitable, but also opportunities for children to learn how their actions can affect themselves and others.\n\n## Ages 9–12\n\nAt this stage, children are juggling the pressures of peer relationships and the physical and psychological changes that accompany growing up. Many are getting their own smartphones, and some began to use social media as early as age 7. They’re also starting to use digital platforms to do homework, often on school-owned laptops or tablets. As their digital footprints grow, their online reputations will develop.\n\n**Talk about the differences between using personal and school devices.** School accounts are linked to a child’s name, and school devices often come with monitoring software that allows school personnel to see what children are doing online. Some systems will automatically flag it when students type or search for suspicious or inappropriate content. Explain to your student that what they do on their school devices affects their reputation too.\n\n**Pick a unique username on social media and multiplayer games.** If your child is gaming or using social media, encourage them to avoid using their first or last name in their username and to use privacy settings to limit the audience.\n\n**Resist the temptation to monitor everything they do or post.** Be aware of what digital platforms your child uses and what they do online. But don’t snoop. After all, when you were in middle school, did you want your parents eavesdropping on your conversations with friends? Instead, work with your child to establish boundaries. In a study I did with the University of Maryland’s Human Computer Interaction Lab, our team found that children are more comfortable with parents monitoring their location and seeing their contacts than they are with parents checking their text messages. Children recognize the importance of parental oversight when it comes to their physical safety, but they also want space to develop relationships with others.\n\n**Help your child push back against peer pressure.** Recognize that your child will likely encounter difficult situations online, and let your child know that you’re there to help them work through it. For instance, your child may see peers posting threats or mean comments about someone, or they may be asked to send inappropriate photos. If your child participates in online harassment or feels pressured into sexting, they could create a digital footprint that not only affects their reputation, but could also put them in difficult situations. Make sure your child knows that if they see anything online that makes them uncomfortable, they can come to you or another trusted adult for help.\n\n## Ages 13–17\n\nTeenagers are navigating peer and romantic relationships while grappling with the daunting reality of transitioning into adulthood. By this point, they’re well aware of how digital interactions affect their reputations, and your role is to support them while also respecting their growing autonomy. That means seeking opportunities to connect but not forcing the conversation.\n\n**Set a Google Alert for your child’s name**. If something comes up, show it to them and ask them how they feel about that information being attached to their name and available for anyone to see. These alerts don’t apply to mentions in chat rooms and most social media platforms, though. And it’s important to approach this conversation from a place of curiosity, rather than judgment. You want your teen to open up, not shut down.\n\n**Lean in, don’t lecture. **While it might be tempting to focus on how your teen’s online reputation may affect their college or job prospects, resist the urge to lecture. Teens are going through the tumultuous experience of experimenting with different kinds of identities and confronting profound questions about who they want to be and what they want to do. While only they can ultimately answer those questions, you can show them you’ll stand by them no matter what others think of them.\n\nShepherding your child’s online reputation can feel daunting, but remember, your role is to guide and support rather than force or control. Keep the lines of communication open with your child, and appreciate the chance to watch them grow into themselves.\n\nMonitor their location and new contacts with Smart Family.",

      "content": "# Is gaming the new social media?\n\n## With more social interactivity built into the gaming experience, it’s virtually a new social reality for kids today. Here’s what parents and caregivers need to know to set some pregame rules.\n\n\nI’ve worked in IT for over 17 years. In the lunchroom of my first IT company, there were several TVs with attached gaming systems. Most of the techs would gather there every day to play multiplayer games during our lunch break. These gaming sessions were really important to our company culture and helped us form amazing bonds. Most of my current friends came from the relationships I formed at that company. Teens were hopping on the multiplayer games wagon, too, by creating experiences where several friends would gather in one place to play a specific multiplayer game.\n\nFast forward to the digital world of 2021: Gaming together in person has moved online. And now, many kids’ first experiences with social media are occurring through gaming platforms. Online games like Roblox, Minecraft, Animal Jam and so many more not only have quests you can embark on together, they also have rooms you can customize and characters you can become. The two most popular games kids are playing, Fortnite and Among Us, have social components. New studies suggest that for some teens, gaming could be better than social media.\n\nSo what do parents need to know about this new social-play trend? And why is gaming becoming the preferred place for teens to hang?\n\n## It’s more than just a “like.”\n\nTeens are no longer content to just share photos and status updates with their friends—they want to interact with their friends. This is why platforms like Roblox and Snap Games and trending videos on TikTok that feature gamers have become so popular. They offer more than just sharing pictures and videos of what’s happening in your life. You are able to compete, play and spend quality time with your friends through online gaming platforms. For example, instead of just commenting on a photo of what your friend ate for dinner, you can go on an adventure together to slay a dragon or build a city. Coordinating attacks or problem-solving together is much more enticing for kids who grew up on technology than simply sharing status updates.\n\n## Gaming provides a virtual connection.\n\nDuring 2020, we quickly learned how to interact with our friends in a completely different way. Instead of being able to get together to have fun and play games with one another, we found virtual ways to play. Multiplayer games with social components like in-game chat or working together as a team help kids keep in touch with their friends they could no longer see in person.\n\n## To be blunt: It’s still cool because their parents aren’t all over it.\n\nNo matter how much parents want their kids to love all the things they love, as soon as their parents start using something their kids are using, it’s just not as cool. When parents started using Facebook, kids migrated over to Instagram. Now that grown-ups are using Instagram, kids moved on to Snapchat and TikTok.\n\nWell, guess what? Adults are using Snapchat and TikTok now too, so the kids are moving on to multiplayer games. Kids are not loyal to a specific platform and will quickly jump ship, which also makes gaming great for them. It allows them to interact during the game but doesn’t lock them into a specific platform for their social interactions.\n\n## Get the download.\n\n\n## Set some pre-game rules.\n\n\n## Play in the open.\n\nGaming chats are text- or voice-based interactions that occur between the different players currently in the game. These chats are a great way for kids to interact during quests and when building worlds. They can be an important aspect of the game itself and can help kids work together to solve a problem.\n\nHowever, these chats are open to the public. One way to help your child stay safe while gaming online is to allow social gaming only in open areas, and maybe even limit it to larger devices, such as the main TV in the family room or a desktop computer that is in a general area of the house. If they play on a larger tablet or smart TV in the family room, you can keep an eye on things without hovering. If someone is being inappropriate, you can have a conversation with your child about what happened and what they can do about it in the future.\n\n## Talk about the potential dangers.\n\nIs there someone asking for personal information like a phone number or what school they go to? Do they ask them or other people in the game to take the conversation out of the game? Are they overly complimentary? All of these things should be warning flags.\n\nTell your kids to never give out personal information, including social media usernames on other platforms. Also educate them on grooming and how it works. For example, “grooming” happens when a stranger in the game shows a lot of interest in your child or someone else in the game and offers them in-game rewards or is constantly telling them how good or smart they are at the game. Let them know that it can be tempting to interact since it feels good to be complimented, but to not put too much effort into the conversation, and perhaps even move on from that game for a little while.\n\nTalk with your kids about “friending” strangers. Often, gaming chats are limited to the game itself. However, once two accounts become “friends” inside a game, they can interact in private chats and continue conversations outside of the gaming session. Only allow kids to become friends with people in a game that they know in person.\n\n## Check the game rating.\n\nMost games are rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which should give parents a good idea of what age groups the game is appropriate for.\n\nThe ESRB website can give very specific details about the game, such as “users interact,” meaning that not all interactions are completely monitored, which might affect your decision to let your child play the game. A lot of research goes into these ratings, so it is a great idea to look it up and pay attention to the age recommendations.\n\n## How to support your kids’ interest\n\n\n## Check your speeds.\n\nWhen you are playing online with friends in real time, your speed can become a significant issue. As your group joins in a battle, you could affect the outcome if your system is lagging. Lag is when your data speeds or device can’t keep up with what is happening in the game. This causes the game to pause and glitch. As you can imagine, during an interactive game with multiple players, lag on anyone’s part can be unacceptable.\n\nIf your teen is going to play games often as a form of social interaction, make sure you have the appropriate speed and device to play properly. If the rest of the group is constantly waiting on you to finish your part of the construction or they need your response to a question in order to finish the game, they may just stop asking you to play with them. As the future of gaming transforms along with technology like 5G, speed and connectivity play a crucial role in the overall gaming experience.\n\n## Play it safe and talk it out.\n\nMany games will allow parents to turn on filtering for chat functions, but this can only work for text-based chats. Voice-based chats are a little harder to monitor since the filter wouldn’t be able to detect words in real time.\n\nAs chats can be limited in-game, many kids prefer to take their discussions outside of the game and into another platform like Discord. For the most part, I do not recommend allowing this, unless your child knows the person they are talking to in person.\n\nA great suggestion for your kids is to have them call their friends on the phone or hook up a video conference while they play online together. This will allow them the same interaction as sitting with each other while playing the game but includes the added benefit of social distancing.\n\nGaming has definitely changed from the days of Pong and Pac-Man. The social aspect has transformed the experience from way more than just a game: They’re fully immersive interactive experiences. Start the conversation early about what’s appropriate in your house, and keep the conversation going.\n\n*Ready to take the conversation offline?

      "content": "# Take your kids on a virtual field trip—right now\n\n## Try this augmented reality experience with your smartphone and bring to life some of Smithsonian’s museums and galleries.\n\n\nMany of the nation’s schools have reopened this fall, but their daily activities have undoubtedly altered. Rather than relying solely on face-to-face classroom lessons, many schools now utilize virtual solutions that allow children to remain at a safe distance while learning remotely. It’s not just our schools that must lean on technology to usher in new ways of educating our kids; parents also need to become savvy digital teachers in the age of COVID.\n\nThe pandemic poses an opportunity for parents and schools to connect with students in novel ways. Technologists and designers are hard at work creating tools that provide children with immersive learning experiences. It’s not hard to find a parent who will tell you that a child attending class through video conferencing does not hold the attention of the student or classmates for very long.\n\nBut what if we give students information in new forms using technology that can create a more engaging experience?\n\n## Putting tech to work\n\nVirtual reality (VR) has proven itself as an effective learning tool because immersive experiences can increase memory, learning and spatial mapping. Augmented reality (AR) blends the real and virtual worlds together, bringing some of those benefits along with it. AR allows the user to place objects in a room with the use of a camera and a smartphone. It can also allow you to manipulate virtual objects and see various angles in 3D.\n\nTry it now by scanning this QR code with your smartphone camera:\n\n## How it all works\n\nVerizon’s 5G Labs utilized the Smithsonian Open Access Initiative’s library collection to aid parents, students and teachers looking for new and engaging educational content. This effort brings a virtual field trip to the comfort of your home. You can now point your phone or tablet at a QR code, then watch the museum artifact come to life virtually. Imagine learning all about how the woolly mammoth became extinct while walking around its 3D skeleton.\n\nThe AR content, accompanied by narrated audio, brings to life artifacts housed across Smithsonian’s network of museums and galleries. This means that even though access to enter museums is currently off limits, learning from the Smithsonian’s exhibits is still limitless through this technology.\n\n## Verizon 5G Labs AR Experiences Include:\n\nUS Historical Figures such as Hellen Keller and her teacher Anne Sullivan\n\nAir & Space artifacts such as the 1903 Wright Flyer or the Cassiopeia Supernova\n\nInnovative Inventions that changed the world like the Morse Vail Telegraph\n\nObjects from the Arts like the costume boots from The Wiz Broadway revival\n\nExtinct Animals that come back to life in your living room such as the Woolly Mammoth\n\n\nIt’s important for parents and teachers to explore every avenue of education during this time where learning-at-home becomes the new normal. By bringing technology and educational content together in new ways, we’re working to make it easier for you to help your child learn.\n\n*Verizon pledges to provide 10 million youths with digital skills training and 1 million small businesses with resources to help them thrive in the digital economy by 2030.

      "content": "# Beyond the gaming console: Making friends outside the gaming life\n\n## More parents worry about their kids’ ability to make friends in a pandemic world, but their gaming friendships just might be helping them through it.\n\n\nToday’s kids and teenagers have never lived in a world without the internet. They’re hyper-connected to real-life and virtual friends via social media, online games, numerous chat apps, email and more. Yet, “making friends is both harder and easier than it was when we were young,” says Amanda Farough, a writer, editor and mom of four who writes often about the intersection of gaming and parenting.\n\n“When we were kids, we had our home phone and if we were fortunate enough to have a computer in our homes, we would eventually use messaging apps like ICQ, MSN Messenger and AOL IM,” says Farough. “Regardless, we were limited by our neighborhoods almost entirely. If we went to school together, we could maybe have a chance at being friends.”\n\nCompare that to 2021, when “kids can talk whenever they want to through their various devices, but they’re never truly away from one another.” But too much time online is a major concern for parents today, and with gaming becoming a big coping mechanism for kids during the pandemic, parents worry kids will lose the people skills needed to make friends in person. According to a new survey of 2,000 parents with kids ages 5 to 14, 70% worry that their kids have forgotten how to interact with other children due to a year of remote learning and lockdowns. What’s more, two in three parents fear that their children will be more awkward around others, and 62% worry that their child won’t be able to pick up where they left off, socially speaking, once in-person school resumes.\n\nSound familiar? In reality, kids today often have extended online social circles via their favorite video games, but if you didn’t grow up a gamer, it can be intimidating to talk to your kids about making friends in real time. We asked Farough for her advice on how to help your kids keep those friend connections going, on and offline.\n\n## Online vs. IRL: What’s the difference?\n\nFor many kids, guided activities like school provides them with the chance to be close to others in the same age range. From there, real-life connections grow. They hang out with kids from other schools in Little League or at summer camp, and then meet friends of those friends.\n\n“Making friends through friends is often how kids broaden their social circles,” Farough says.\n\nIn some ways, making friends through video games is similar. It’s not unusual for young people to make connections through their favorite multiplayer games, whether that’s on a smartphone, console or PC. Through games, kids can find like-minded friends that they may not be able to find at school or at after-school activities.\n\n“There’s an abundance of very close connections during gaming that’s difficult to have during guided activities, including school. You get to spend time one-on-one [or in small groups] playing games and solving puzzles collaboratively,” Farough says. “There’s time for deeper conversations about life—and the game—that wouldn’t be possible while a coach or instructor is leading an activity.”\n\nFarough stresses that all of these connections, whether in person or virtual, are meaningful, but parents should be aware that “connecting while playing games together can be socially enriching in unexpected ways.”\n\n## The ongoing 2020 effect on gaming and friendships\n\nThe pandemic kept many kids away from classrooms, sports, clubs and in-person events. Stuck inside, mobile use skyrocketed and video games provided a much-needed escape. Farough reported that almost everyone in her household—kids and parents—played more games during the pandemic.\n\n“They didn’t make new friends in games, per se, but they definitely strengthened relationships with their existing friends,” Farough said of her children. “Games kept our kids and their friends together when they couldn’t see each other face to face.”\n\nWith a new school year about to begin, children may struggle to shift from online to IRL relationships.\n\n“My two eldest children have both struggled quite a bit more with their social interactions and behavior since they’ve been learning remotely since March 2020,” Farough said. Her oldest, who’s in high school, now becomes overwhelmed in large crowds and had to go back to remote learning after two months back in school. “She isn’t super interested in meeting anyone new.”\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that while some kids might have an easier time making friends in games or online, others prefer in-person interactions. Farough finds that this often “depends on the age” of children. In many cases, younger ones have more boundaries in place when it comes to online relationships.\n\n“I’ve often told my kids that online and offline are entirely the same in that you should take both of these kinds of friendships equally as seriously.”\n\n## Advice for parents\n\nWhether offline or online, Farough says the most important advice she can give kids about making friends is to lead with kindness. There are other ways to apply online social techniques to IRL interactions as well.\n\n**Listen twice as much as you speak.**Online, it’s easier not to talk over each other. There’s a message and a response. Treat offline conversations similarly: Take pauses, make sure you’re listening and comprehending instead of just responding, and don’t push anyone past their comfort level. “When we’re making new friends, we ensure that there is safety for all parties involved, which means that everyone respects everyone’s boundaries,” Farough says.**Remind kids that it’s actually normal to struggle with making friends.**Online, kids can self-select and choose the players that match and challenge their abilities. That isn’t always true in groups offline, where they’re in a group of kids with all kinds of different abilities. “Making friends at school and during activities is very hard when your kid isn’t the same as their peers, whether that’s having completely different interests or just not being ‘the norm.’ As parents, we want our kids to be healthy, happy and whole, which means that we want them to have friends that help them achieve those emotional goals.”**Give advice that is appropriate for them, not for you at that age.**“The best thing to do, as parents, is to reinforce the good things in our kids’ personalities. Listen; don’t try to fix the problem. Never condescend to them—they know when you’re being insincere or you’re just brushing them off.”**Try the value alignment conversation.**Farough and her children talk at length about the kind of person that they are and the kind of person that they want to grow into, which helps them to identify what they value in others. “The value alignment conversation really opened my kid up to understand that potential friends are everywhere and that not everyone thinks poorly of them. You can’t please everyone, so just find one or two people that already like you for you so you can build from there.” In other words, help them to become the kind of person they’d want to be friends with.**Set boundaries.**Farough says the “biggest boundary” she put in place with her younger children is to “never to give away personal identifying information to anyone that they don’t know in person, which includes real names.” That might be harder for modern kids to understand, given the prevalence of personal information displayed on social media and the tendency to overshare.\n\nFor today’s kids, being extremely online might make digital interactions easier than in-person ones. One type of friendship isn’t more important than the other, but like with most things in life, balance is important. By showing your kids the similarities between making friends online and IRL, you’ll help them develop healthy social skills that will benefit them in almost any situation.\n\n*Making friends isn’t easy, but helping your kid stay safe online can be with a little help from Smart Family.*",

      "content": "# Real talk about photo-editing apps with your teens\n\n## They weren’t designed to remove your authenticity.\n\n\nWhen it comes to selfies, there’s a few tricks to get that perfect shot: Use natural lighting, hold the camera high and at an angle, add your favorite filter before publishing on Instagram. But, with more photo-retouching apps and filters becoming available, it’s worth taking a second look at what these apps and filters can do, and the kind of pictures your teen posts of themselves online.\n\n#### What can photo-editing apps do?\n\nSome aspects of photo editing are largely harmless. Some apps allow users to change up some simple things, like the lighting, color and shadows. Some allow users to make more complex, cosmetic changes, like whiten teeth, clear up a few zits, and even change body or face shape. Airbrushed images can give the illusion of perfection—perfect hair, skin or body shape. And one of the newest upgrades to Facetune 2, a popular portrait and selfie editor app, lets users make changes to a portrait in real time, so you can change a person’s cosmetic features before they even tap the shutter.\n\n#### Who uses them?\n\nA lot of people, actually. The early adoption of the photo-retouching app Facetune by celebrities, athletes and social media influencers helped the app reach millions of selfie-takers. In 2017, it was one of Apple’s top app downloads.\n\n#### What can this mean to your teen or preteen?\n\nEveryone who follows celebrity accounts are viewing images of a beauty icon that they likely perceive to be authentic. In reality, though, the pictures aren’t real—they’re altered in order to reach a higher level of unnatural attraction.\n\nWhen adolescents see celebrities with perfected physical features, they may not understand that the image has been altered. However, when your child’s friends begin to post edited images that remove all blemishes and imperfections, the expectation of perfection begins to encroach on your child’s personal world.\n\nNot only do photo-editing apps allow your child to present a falsified image to the world, but it encourages them to critically examine what they want to change about their appearance, often preferring an artificial physical identity over their authentic self.\n\n#### What we can do as parents?\n\nLike many other issues that arise with emerging technology, the use of photo-editing apps requires a conversation with your child regarding safe and healthy practices. It is important that your child understands that some of the images they see, even of some of their peers, may be edited in some fashion.\n\nIt is also a good idea to review the photo-editing apps that your teen uses and discuss the different features available to them. You and your child can decide together which tools foster healthy and artistic choices, and which features may not be a good idea to use on their photos. Engaging in open discussions as to why some editing features are potentially unhealthy not only leads them away from using them now, but it encourages your child to understand why portraying their real self is important going into their adult life.\n\n*This article was authored by staff at the Family Online Safety Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to empower parents to confidently navigate the digital world with their kids.

Take the quiz.\n\n## These are the surprising answers teens gave to a new survey that asks what they’re watching on their phones.\n\n\nThink you know what your teen is watching on their phone? Let’s find out.\n\nA recent survey asked 2,400 teenagers in the US what videos they watch, on what device, and where they find new content. The research was conducted by Magid, Verizon’s research partner, as part of an ongoing Video Entertainment Study that looks at video content trends. While it may seem like teens today are consumed by 15-second videos and stories, the study results were a little unexpected.\n\nReady to find out what’s happening on most teens’ screens? Take the quiz.\n\nThe answer? C. More than 40% of teens said they watch TV shows and movies. That’s twice as much as any other weekly video viewing activity. Here are the top five answers, in order:\n\n1. Full-length movies (43%)\n\n2. Full-length TV shows (43%)\n\n3. Music videos (21%)\n\n4. Videos created by specific channels that can be found on services like YouTube and TikTok (21%)\n\n5. Videos created by specific personalities that can be found on services like YouTube and TikTok (19%)\n\nMore insight for parents: While it may be surprising that kids are watching traditional content like TV shows and movies, two genres may drive this trend: 68% said they watch comedy and 62% watch action and suspense.\n\nThe answer: B. A typical teen will watch 11 hours of YouTube videos weekly. TikTok is close behind. Teens spend an average of about 10 hours a week watching TikTok video content.\n\nMore insight for parents: While TikTok is just behind YouTube in terms of time spent watching videos, TikTok is the app most used by teens, with 69% saying they use the app weekly. (Oh, and BeReal was a trick answer: You can’t watch video on BeReal. Yet.)\n\nThe answer: C. Friends and family: 59% of teens say that recommendations from friends are how they find new videos. About one-third of teens also discover new videos through online recommendations—the algorithm-driven “for you” recommendations.\n\nMore insight for parents: As streaming services and social media apps compete for teens’ attention, it’s essential for parents to keep an eye on those “for you” recommendations to make sure they’re appropriate. And with word-of-mouth also leading the way, parents and teens can have ongoing conversations about what their friends are talking about watching, too.\n\nThe answer: C. Teens watch more live streaming video content than any other age group in the study. Live streaming content can vary, from watching streams from friends and family on social media, to watching influencers and celebrities sharing online events or podcast-like streams. Virtual classes are another form of live streamed video in this category.\n\nAbout one-third of teens watch live streams every day on social media sites such as TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. And 20% of teens watch live streams more than once daily.\n\nMore insight for parents: One-third of Gen Xers and one-quarter of boomers said they watch live streaming video less than once a month or never. Which means parents may want to ask their teens more questions about what live streaming videos they like to watch and why.\n\nThe answer: C. Internet-connected TV is the top device teens use to watch video content. TV makes up 42% of teen video viewing time. However, smartphone video viewing is closing the gap: It’s the second-most popular way to watch video among teens at 39%.\n\nMore insight for parents: All generations watch more video content on internet-connected TVs, but teens watch videos on smartphones more than any other generation. For comparison, 47% of Gen Xers watch videos on TV, while only 22% of them watch on smartphones. For boomers, 64% watch videos on TV, while only 14% rely on smartphones for video viewing.\n\nWell, how did it go? Ideally, this quiz brings a little clarity to any assumptions you may have about what teens are watching on their phones today. And hopefully, it prompts more conversation about what you can watch together.\n\n## Conversation starter\n\n## Do you watch a lot of live streaming videos?\n\nMonitor what they’re watching online, and talk together about building healthy digital habits with Smart Family.",

The goal: Help them make their own decisions about what feels safe and what’s not acceptable.\n\n\nLike many parents, I used to think that bringing up sensitive topics like inappropriate content found online had to be done at just the right time and in just the right way. However, I’ve learned over the years that it’s far better for our children, and much easier on parents, to start these important conversations early.\n\nWhy? Our kids might be exposed to inappropriate content earlier than we expect. Studies show that it can happen to children as young as 7. However, parents can help their children prepare for these encounters by discussing early what your family considers inappropriate—and knowing how to handle the situation if (or when) your child does see something inappropriate online. As a parent of five boys and the founder of Parents Aware—an organization that assists parents in initiating these conversations—I’ve helped many families engage in these important discussions.\n\nBuilding up to these discussions using correct language and terminology can show our kids that we are prepared to talk, that our home is a safe place to ask questions, and that nothing is too awkward or embarrassing to discuss. That said, sometimes circumstances force our hands, and we need to have the conversations sooner than we want to.\n\nWith that in mind, we’ve created this guide to help with the conversation, starting with what to do if your child is exposed to inappropriate content online—because that situation can be so urgent. We’ll also share an age-by-age guide to how to have meaningful conversations on this difficult topic.\n\nScreenshot this for later\n\n### See an Objectionable Content Alert in Verizon Family?\n\n- Don't assume the worst. Research suggests that children’s online searches are often driven by curiosity rather than intentional misbehavior.\n- Use notifications as opportunities for open dialogue. Talk with your child about what makes certain content inappropriate.\n- Pause and reflect before reacting. Take a deep breath and ask your teen what questions they have or if they need additional support from you.\n- Listen with care and empathy.\n\nverizon.com/parenting\n\n## Age-by-age guidance to prepare for content conversations\n\n**Ages 3–5:** In most cases, children this age should not be left alone with any device that’s connected to the internet or has a camera—even when it’s something as simple as watching drawing videos or cartoons. Parents can also check the built-in parental controls on their devices as a safeguard against questionable content.\n\n**Ages 6–8:** In my own research and experience with families, children this age can be exposed to inappropriate content online. This is when kids start to spend more time away from home with friends, at school or on playdates. It can be intimidating to bring up the topic of media safety with other parents. But I have found that families often share similar concerns. This makes having these conversations easier.\n\nSome kids have food allergies. Some kids have nightmares when they watch scary movies. And some parents talk with other parents before a playdate or sleepover to make sure those needs are communicated. The media safety conversation can happen in that same space.\n\n**Try this question:** “We have a family rule that kids at this age are only allowed to be on the internet when an adult is present. Is that a policy at your house?”\n\n**Ages 9–12:** Many kids get their first phone around this age. Each new device that comes into the house is an opportunity to review your family’s media plan. I always encourage parents to get their kids involved in that plan.\n\nIt can start with a few self-reflective questions: “How can my media use align with my hopes, dreams and values? Does what I am doing today align with where I want to go?” Using the red, yellow and green light as a metaphor to stop, pause or go, consider the following:\n\n**Green light: **Doing homework, talking with Grandma, or looking up videos about making something. Anything that reinforces those stated goals fall into this category.\n\n**Yellow light: **Does the time you spend on a certain activity online take up most of the day? For example, when friends come over, can you put it down and spend time with them? Do you have trouble turning off the tech when asked?\n\n**Red light: **Anything that doesn’t align with those hopes, dreams and values, and your families’ tech boundaries. Shut it down right away. Tell a trusted adult for added safety.\n\n**Age 13–18: **At this age, kids are becoming more autonomous online. If they want to find something—even if it’s inappropriate content—they’ll find it. So they need to know there’s a safe place at home where they can ask important questions. Often, kids are afraid that if they do, they’ll get in trouble and lose their tech. Their fear of losing access to the phone can override their desire to talk about what’s going on.\n\nI know stories about young women who have confided in friends, but not a parent, when they felt pressured to text intimate photos to someone at school.\n\nThat’s why we need to put these difficult conversations on the table. Kids are faced with difficult scenarios. It’s not fair to have them navigate these things on their own—to solve big adult problems without having someone they can talk to.\n\nTo make space for these conversations, consider the following:\n\n**Make ongoing connection a priority. **Once a week or once a month, let them choose an activity, or a place to eat for lunch, or spend time talking together about something that interests them. The idea is to build a space for ongoing connection so it’s easier to talk about the tougher things.\n\n**Consider alternatives to taking the phone away as punishment. **When boundaries get crossed, ask your teen to help you come up with some consequences instead of simply taking the phone away. Their solutions might surprise you. Another approach is to ask, “Would it be helpful to you if we set stronger tech boundaries together?”\n\n**Take the pressure off.** If you’re just starting out, shoulder-to-shoulder conversations are best. Teenagers tend to open up more when the conversation feels more casual. So think of natural ways to avoid eye contact. Whether you’re riding in a car or making the family dinner together, these are ideal times to bring up challenging topics.\n\n## How to manage your child’s access to inappropriate content\n\nThe goal of these conversations is to raise critical consumers of technology. When the focus remains on blocking content, kids simply are not learning how to make decisions on their own. Family safety meetings can become a regular part of your tech routine—and another low-pressure way to talk about online safety together.\n\n## How to report inappropriate content online\n\nIf you or your child discovers inappropriate content of any kind on a social media platform or other space where it is prohibited, report it. The mechanics of reporting inappropriate content vary, but virtually all major platforms encourage users to report material that violates the platform’s guidelines.\n\nHowever, never forward any sexual content that involves minors, even in an attempt to report it. Doing so is against federal law and it perpetuates the abuse of victims. For a detailed explanation and instructions on how to report child sexual abuse material (CSAM), read this article from Thorn.\n\n## You can do this\n\nSometimes I hear people say, “Kids don’t want their parents to talk to them about sensitive topics.” That’s simply not true. That sentiment implies we don’t know how to approach these conversations with our children. But we can work on that.\n\nLooking back, if I could be a new parent again, afforded a do-over, I would place a greater priority on talking to my children about inappropriate content earlier. Of course, it is never too late. My children are older, and frankly, because I now have the courage to be open and honest with them, our conversations are much better. We laugh more, and the trust between us has grown. These conversations have the potential to strengthen parent-child relationships and can bring you and your child closer together.\n\nThe right tools can help you know when to step in and talk.

      "content": "# Tech talk: Exploring the emotional side of AI for kids and teens\n\n## A parent and child’s safety expert explores the connection between a teens’ mental health and AI, and what parents can watch for to ensure their kids use AI responsibly.\n\n\nReady for an awkward question? I recently did a little experiment with my 16-year-old son and an artificial intelligence chatbot (AI) that kids and students are using for all kinds of things, like asking questions to help with their homework, or making art or music.\n\nWith my son looking over my shoulder, I typed in an awkward search request that some kids may not ask a parent or teacher, but might Google. The AI chatbot responded, much as a search engine would to a query, but not with hundreds and hundreds of links listed on search results pages. Instead, it produced a well-written response, with an introduction, a checklist of helpful suggestions, and a tight concluding paragraph with resources to find more information.\n\nSo, with my son cringing next to me, I typed again: “I’m sad.” The AI chatbot wrote back saying, “Well, why? Why do you think you’re sad? Maybe you should contact the national helpline.”\n\nSuddenly, I went from being curious to having a very emotional conversation with this artificial intelligence. As a parent, a child’s digital rights and safety expert and an attorney, I started wondering about the connection between AI, emotions and teenagers.\n\nAsking awkward questions is part of being a teenager. And AI chatbots could have an effect like that of a Magic 8 Ball—the plastic billiard ball you shake to get advice in the form of one of 20 answers: “Ask again later.” “It is decidedly so.” “You may rely on it.” It was designed to be a toy, but young people could ask questions and get answers—and believe they were real answers. Like whether Robert would invite you to his ballgame. If you were like me, you kept shaking the ball until you got the answer you wanted, but I digress.\n\nAs AI for kids and teens makes its meteoric rise, parents and kids need to talk about what’s appropriate to ask in these chats and what to do with the answers. AI does not have emotions. But people—and especially young people—asking questions do have emotions. It’s important to tell your kids that if they find themselves asking AI emotional questions, that’s a sign they need to turn to a parent or adult.\n\nIs it time to ask your teen about this? It is decidedly so. If you know they are actively using an AI chat–such as ChatGPT–or if they are at an appropriate age and maturity level to do so, then it's important to observe how they're responding to it. Here are some things to consider and watch for.\n\n**Online interactions can impact emotions.** As in the real world, interactions and exchanges with AI chat bots can have both positive and negative effects on your teenager’s mood and well-being. Research shows that most teens say social media strengthens their friendships, but they recognize the emotional charge that comes with it. The emotional impact on kids interacting with AI is still unknown, but it’s important to notice both the positive and negative emotional outcomes your child may experience while using it.\n\n**Watch their body language and behavior.** If your preteens and teens are using AI, and it’s age-appropriate, make it a point to use it with them and monitor how they use it. Pay attention to their body language and behavior. As with any online interaction, are they engaged and enjoying the experience, or do they seem upset or frustrated? If you notice something seems a little off, trust your intuition; then listen, understand and empathize.\n\n**Manage emotions and expectations.** Teenagers could feel overwhelmed or upset by the AI-generated responses to their questions and the endless possible responses if questions are rephrased. If your teenager is feeling upset while using AI, help them develop strategies for managing their emotions. This may include taking a break from technology, engaging in physical activity or talking to someone they trust. If your teenager is positively engaged and enjoying their online activities, ask them to share tips for creating content that you might enjoy.\n\n**Talk about strategies for using AI safely.** As with other online interactions and technology, encourage your teens not to share personal information and not to use any identifiable information in questions they ask. Remind teens that every answer they get needs to be verified with a trusted adult or a reliable source. You could even review ChatGPT’s principles and discuss how to use it safely and responsibly.\n\nIf you’re wondering how it went with my son, the conversation that followed went pretty well. He thinks I’m a little weird (par for the course), but he knows now that an AI chatbot is not a human or a therapist and is in no way a substitute for professional mental health care. And he also knows that if he, or any of his friends, are posing emotional questions, it’s better to talk to a parent, a teacher, a school counselor or another trusted adult who can truly provide support and guidance.\n\nAll in all, I’m confident that we can give our teens a better response than a Magic 8 Ball can.\n\n## Conversation starter\n\n## How does AI make you feel?\n\nKeep the conversation going about using new technology with their well-being in mind—with Smart Family.",

      "content": "# Tech Talk: The disappearing line between screen time and real time.\n\n## The time spent on screens shapes your child’s identity as much as the time they spend offline. An educator explains how to stop the scroll and make screen time more meaningful.\n\n\nChildren today are part of the first generation to grow up navigating who they are both online and offline. When a young person signs into a game as “CATFRIEND19,” there are other children who only know them by this handle. But how are they showing up online? Are they kind? Are they intentional with their actions? Or do they simply view their actions as “screen time” with no true implications in the real world?\n\nFor today’s child, the line between screen time and real time is disappearing as they’re shaping two identities at the same time: How they want to show up online and how they want to show up in the real world.\n\nThink about it: They are experiencing both worlds. They aren’t just passively consuming screen time, they’re experiencing screen time. And how they experience screen time is dependent upon how effective parents and caregivers are in teaching and modeling ways to show up with integrity online.\n\nHere are a few ways parents and caregivers can help them do that.\n\n**Self-awareness is important.** Always talk with them about who they want to be when they show up online. This includes letting them be involved when choosing usernames for shared apps. Let them choose names that represent what matters to them or the kind of person they want to be. This will help them take their digital identities and screen time seriously, versus believing that usernames are characters that they can hide behind.\n\n**Ask:** “How were you your favorite self online today?” Be a deep listener and be nonjudgmental. This will also provide you with an opportunity to form a closer connection with your young person. Note that you are asking them about being their favorite self rather than their best self. Being their favorite self empowers them to be a version of themselves that’s based on their creation, not what they’ve been praised for by others.\n\n**Accountability is key.** Hold them accountable to being kind online in the same way that you hold them accountable at school. For example, “Did you talk to anyone online today? Did you make any comments today? What did you say? Why? What type of content did you watch today? How does that help you? Why are you interested in that? Is there anyone online that you compare yourself to?”\n\nIf they are too young to answer such questions, simply answer them yourself. “We’re going to watch Blippi because he’s educational and I like how he has lots of kind energy.” Or “Today, I compared myself to someone who has more followers than I do, but then I reminded myself that the number of followers I have isn’t important.”\n\n**Ask:** “How did you communicate with others online today?” It may take a while for your young person to understand how to answer this question, because conscious communication online is not often taught at school or at home. Try to model conscious communication by offering your own example. You can even highlight a way that you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone to compliment someone, make friends or model kindness online.\n\n**Boundaries are necessary.** Not everyone is who they say they are online, and profile photos can be deceiving. It’s important to empower children with information on how to engage or disengage during screen time, versus simply telling them not to talk to strangers.\n\nFor example, if they’re approached by a stranger online or someone asks a question that makes them feel uneasy, they can always reply: “Would you like to talk to my dad?” regardless of whether their dad is around or not. This can also be helpful if your child plays video games with a headset that allows them to converse with strangers. This sentence can also serve as a signal for a family member, or another trusted adult in the room, to hop in for support.\n\n**Ask:** “Who asked you a personal question today? Did anyone ask you to keep a secret?” Use this time to talk about how to respond if someone said something that made them feel uncomfortable.\n\n**Critical thinking is valuable. **The internet is filled with false information, and it is imperative for children to learn that they can’t believe everything they read or see. Ask them what they learned online today, just like you would ask them what they’ve learned at school.\n\n**Ask:** “What did you learn today?” Sharing stories of your own experience could also be helpful.\n\n**Navigation is a superpower. **When a child is interested in dancing, we typically take them to dance lessons. Teaching a young person ways to use the online space to further develop their interests will help them to learn to use tech as a superpower.\n\nUnfortunately, many children simply use screen time to play games or watch YouTube videos, because that’s how they’ve been taught to use the tool. Helping them regularly use technology to connect to others and to build a digital world that represents who they want to be will help them to confidently navigate any space, whether it be online or the local playground.\n\n**Ask: **“What would you like to create today?”\n\nIdentity evolves with each generation, and although such rapid advances in technology can compel some to become fearful and protect children as much as possible, remember that sharing your own experience and guidance are forms of protection as well. Helping your child learn how to navigate the online space with confidence is like teaching them to swim. Shielding them from screen time, however, is like not letting them visit the pool.\n\nWhenever you feel yourself questioning their screen time, ask yourself, “Are they scrolling passively online, or are they actively connecting in a meaningful way?”\n\nLearn more about what they’re using online to develop their sense of identity with Smart Family.",

An internet safety expert shares her top talking points.\n\n\nMany adults can’t explain artificial intelligence (AI) to each other, let alone to their kids. And while schools look for guidance and policymakers try to keep AI for kids inclusive and available to every child, Gen Zers are quickly becoming the superusers. They’re using it for homework and in Snapchat. They’re also more likely to have a career that involves AI. That means conversations about AI—including what it is—should be happening at home. A lot.\n\nYou can start right now. Whether you’re new to AI or you’re already using it on the job, here are some age-appropriate ways to explain AI to children, preteens and teens.\n\n## The difference between AI and GenAI\n\nArtificial intelligence can take large amounts of data, analyze it, find patterns and make predictions based on that data. A smart speaker is a great example of AI: It provides answers based on what it’s been programmed to say in response to your questions. GenAI, however, can make new data from the data it’s been given: It can “generate” new data in the form of words, images and even video. In its simplest terms: AI can analyze data but GenAI can create new data (outputs) based on the data it’s been given.\n\nIt’s important to talk about the difference between these technologies, and learn to spot the difference. (Don’t worry if you can’t. We’re all still learning).\n\n## Young children: Share what AI is … and isn’t\n\nIf your children are old enough to read and use a search engine, around the age of 5 or 6, they’re having real-life experience with AI that you can talk about. For example, they’re using AI technology when they do a voice search or ask a smart speaker for something.\n\nWhen you talk to young children about GenAI, however, it can help to keep it simple. For example:\n\n“GenAI lets you use a computer to create all sorts of things, like words, pictures, cartoons, or even movies, without needing to tell the computer exactly what it should create.\n\n“And if you use a computer to draw a picture of a puppy, GenAI could help you draw a really good picture. With GenAI, you can ask the computer to create a picture of a purple puppy wearing clown shoes that can fly in the air with its big ears. And just like magic, the computer can create that cool picture.\n\n“The hard part with GenAI? Sometimes GenAI gives answers that are make-believe, just like bedtime stories. So you need to be able to tell what’s real and what’s make-believe.\n\n“It’s hard to know the difference—GenAI can even trick adults sometimes. But you can always come and talk to me and we can figure it out together. We can be GenAI detectives on the trail to discover the truth.”\n\n**Parent tip: Find a digital safety community online or create your own.** Talk with other parents and caregivers about different tech trends, including developments in AI. There are parent communities on social media that provide engaging content on trends, such as the one I started, The Digital Parenting Community and Family Tech, which is managed by another writer for this web site.\n\n## Preteens: Dig into what’s possible\n\nNine- to 12-year-olds are already using GenAI in apps, games and interactive toys. Using terms that your preteen understands, you can explain that GenAI and AI for kids is like the magical Book of Admittance in the Harry Potter series, or the self-writing book in the movie “The NeverEnding Story.”\n\nWhen you talk to preteens about AI, you can dive deeper into some of the possible concerns. For example:\n\n“Those magical books could write anything they wanted, although you might have to give them a hint or ask a question. Now imagine if those books could draw anything you told them to or make any kind of music you wanted to hear.\n\n“That’s how GenAI can work—as a magical book buddy creating drawings you suggest or answering questions for you. But magical book buddies could play tricks on you, so we need to talk about what’s magic and what’s real.”\n\n**Parent tip: Learn the basics of AI.** Actively seek out information about AI to reduce any anxiety or fear about using this new technology. Use GenAI yourself or ask a colleague to show you some tips and tricks. You’ll also be able to apply your own experiences and observations when you talk to your kids.\n\n## Teens: Guide them to responsible behavior\n\nMost teens have definitely heard of AI, whether it’s ChatGPT or My AI on Snapchat. What they might not know is that, like anything they put online, anything or any prompt they put into a public AI chatbot can be screenshot, shared and read by a human.\n\nAI-based profiling, which predicts what someone might want based on what they look for online or like on social media, can also affect children and teens. This can be a tricky subject, but teens still need to understand the possible consequences of their actions in a digital environment. This report by UNICEF, “Policy guidance on AI for children,\" shares some of the current concerns about AI for kids, which can range from automated discrimination to a lack of data protection and privacy. It’s important that parents understand these concerns.\n\nIt’s also essential to talk about ethical ways for teens to use the technology for schoolwork and ask about their school’s policies on AI.\n\nWith teens, it’s important to ask questions to prompt conversations about AI. For example:\n\n“Hey, I read about a lawyer who used GenAI to write her court documents. Can you imagine what the judge said to her? Let’s go online and check it out.”\n\n**Parent tip: Talk early and often about AI.** I cannot stress this enough when it comes to digital safety and kids: Have open, regular conversations with your children about their online activities. And start early. If your child can understand you, then you can have a connected conversation. Speak with your children about when they see GenAI online or anywhere else, and it will help you stay actively involved in their digital lives.\n\n## What types of activities can you do in your home to teach digital literacy about GenAI and AI for kids?\n\n*Introduction to GenAI*—Ask ChatGPT different questions as a family. Start with “What is ChatGPT?” and “Where do you get your answers?”\n\n*Prompt play*—Ask GenAI tools to create a picture of a CEO, a lawyer, or a doctor. What do you see? Talk with your children about how GenAI answers to questions can be misleading or outright wrong.\n\n*Spotting AI*—Demonstrate how difficult it is to detect whether content was generated by AI by searching online for AI quizzes, such as AI or Human?\n\n*Responsible use of AI in education*—Talk together about when it’s okay to use AI for homework, especially for older children. AI is great for writing essay outlines, using it to ask a question about something you’re really stuck on.\n\n*AI everyday*—Point out when AI shows up in our daily activities, such as predictive speech in email or text.\n\n*AI ethics*—You don’t have to use complicated language with your children to help them understand ethics. Use resources such as AI Literacy from the Family Online Safety Institute to talk with your family about ethics and technology.\n\n## Final takeaway: AI for kids is a tool that’s worth understanding\n\nYou can start the conversation with your kids at a younger age than you may think about AI, GenAI and internet technologies in general. Children need to understand that AI is a tool, and like any tool it has limitations and biases, but digital literacy will guide them on how to use AI effectively and responsibly.\n\nDigital safety starts here.

And if they’re not ready yet, discover the best smartphone alternatives for kids.\n\n\nShould kids have cell phones? It’s the question that every modern parent eventually finds themselves asking. For practical purposes though, when it comes to kids and cell phones, there are actually several questions you should be asking yourself first:\n\nWhy should kids have phones?\n\nDo I need an emergency phone for kids?\n\nWhat other communication devices for kids might fit the bill?\n\nWould smartphone alternatives be a better choice?\n\n\nThen, you might ask yourself follow-up questions such as when should a kid get a phone if you decide that they need one.\n\nAs I often remind families as a futurist, parent and the author of “Parenting High-Tech Kids,” there’s not always a pressing reason to put a smartphone in a child’s hands. However, smart tech can open the door to all sorts of wonderful apps and games for kids, and a wealth of helpful connections and insights. It also means having to prepare kids to greet the challenges that online connectivity and communications often bring.\n\nTaking a few specific items into consideration can help you determine why (or why not) your kids should have phones, and if various smartphone alternatives present a better option.\n\n## When should kids have cell phones?\n\nFirst off: It’s important to be aware that there’s no single universally accepted age at which experts say that kids should have cell phones. A good rule of thumb is 13 years of age, and that presents a fine general baseline to work from. However (and it’s a big however), of course parents will have to make that decision for themselves, based on the child’s maturity and other factors.\n\nHere are some important points to consider and questions to ask yourself when contemplating if your kids should have cell phones:\n\nHow mature and responsible are your children?\n\nTo what extent have you prepared them to react to questionable exchanges or controversial content they may encounter online?\n\nDo you need a communication device for children or an emergency phone for kids for practical reasons?\n\nIs there a compelling purpose to put a cell phone in your child’s hands just yet, or would you be better served by waiting a little longer?\n\n\nAlso important to remember: Before bringing any high-tech device into your home, it’s critical to establish rules and guidelines governing its usage and what content is appropriate to consume and share. That means taking time to specify with your kids how much screen time they’ll have access to daily:\n\nWill screen time be earned or given?\n\nWhen and where it’s appropriate to use communication devices for kids\n\nIf phones must be shut down at certain times of day, such as an hour before bed and during breakfast or dinner\n\n\nIn addition, you’ll want to make it clear that your door is always open as a parent if your children encounter questionable exchanges or content online. You’ll also want to make it clear what the consequences will be if your household rules aren’t followed, and under what circumstances privileges will be regained.\n\n## Why should a kid get a phone?\n\nThe answer depends on when you feel that they’re ready for it, or when there’s a compelling reason to suggest that they really need such a device for purposes of safety or schooling. From a practical standpoint, that typically means when your kids start participating in after-school activities and camps, when they need to get in touch with you remotely while away playing at friends’ houses, or when they’ll otherwise largely be outside of your direct oversight or accessibility, such as walking to class. Similarly, when considering if kids should have cell phones, you’ll want to consider adding a parental control app, such as Smart Family, if they need online access to information, apps or websites to aid with their lessons, assignments and learning.\n\nKeep in mind that introducing various communication devices for kids into your home also means having to make a commitment to do your homework as a parent, as these devices and apps and their respective capabilities are always changing. In addition, you’ll need to make a point of actively working with your children to ingrain positive high-tech habits on a daily basis, such as learning to put down devices while conversing with other family members or by a certain time each evening. On the bright side, as I’ve observed in my own household, kids and cell phones can often be a winning combination. That’s because children have boundless curiosity—and as an always-on, ever-ready gateway to a wealth of online information and activities, smartphones can expose them to a multitude of positive exchanges and experiences … plus new insights, information and individuals.\n\nThat said, giving a child a cell phone effectively means exposing them to the wide virtual world at large. Just as you wouldn’t send them out to play in the neighborhood without teaching them about potential hazards to be aware of, and ingraining good safety habits, you’ll need to prepare them in advance before they play in the digital world. Remember: Technology is simply another tool for learning and communication, and like any tool it’s important to know how to use it responsibly in order to enjoy a positive and uplifting experience.\n\n## What to get your kid instead of a phone\n\nNot ready for your kids to have cell phones yet? That’s perfectly understandable. Parents of younger children especially may wish to consider the many smartphone alternatives for kids.\n\nFor example, a number of child-friendly cell phones for kids are specifically designed to help you communicate and keep tabs on your tot while also setting boundaries on their online access and limiting unwanted communications. Many popular offerings offer extensive parental controls—or eliminate web browsers and app stores entirely—allowing you to control screen time, filter out age-inappropriate material and prohibit access to unwanted apps or websites. Numerous devices also allow you to pre-program friends’ and family members’ contacts into the handset and restrict communications to these individuals. Several models additionally utilize geo-tracking and GPS capabilities to let you follow kids’ movements and limit internet access to preapproved apps and services.\n\nWearables\n\nA variety of wearable smartwatches, like the GizmoWatch, can also provide peace of mind by letting young kids call, video chat or text right from their wrist. Several kids’ wearables make it possible to put to-do lists and daily reminders, such as “Don’t forget to meet Dad for pickup after art class at 4 PM!” at their fingertips.\n\nFlip phones\n\nOf course, many families looking to pick up an emergency phone for kids may also consider equipping them with older flip-phone models that lack extensive internet and app connectivity features or lack cameras and videoconferencing capabilities. Or they may send kids off to school with devices whose connectivity is limited to conversation and calling only. Keep in mind that there are myriad smartphone alternatives for kids available, the majority of which either: (a) introduce helpful high-tech training wheels or (b) allow you to implement parental controls that limit what kids can do, the extent to which they can go online and whom they can communicate with.\n\nSmart trackers\n\nAnswering the question of when a kid should get a phone often becomes easier when you realize you don’t have to dive into the deep end of telecommunications technology right off the bat. If you’re looking to help kids get their feet wet and comfortable with high-tech devices before scaling up to more fully featured systems, you can buy pocket-sized GPS trackers with touch-powered speakers and SOS help buttons that you can send kids to school with as an alternative to smartphones or tablets.\n\nSo the good news is that you don’t have to worry much. If you feel that your child is too young to have a cell phone, a variety of high-tech tools stand ready to help you stay more connected with your children at every turn.\n\nIf your kid is ready for a smartphone, Smart Family will help you put the right controls in place.",

BUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF BOTH PARTIES. THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. BOTH PARTIES ALSO AGREE IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO.\n\nTHE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES THAT QUALIFY, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES FROM VERIZON (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\") OR BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU (\"BBB\").

FOR CLAIMS OVER $10,000, THE AAA'S ARBITRATION RULES WILL APPLY; IN SUCH CASES, THE LOSER CAN ASK FOR A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS TO REVIEW THE AWARD. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THE PARTY BRINGING THE CLAIM CAN CHOOSE EITHER THE AAA'S RULES OR THE BBB'S RULES FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CAN BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THE PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG), THE BBB (WWW.BBB.ORG) OR FROM VERIZON. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THET CUSTOMER MAY CHOOSE WHETHER THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR BY A HEARING IN–PERSON OR BY PHONE.\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA OR BBB PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS PERMISSIBLE. THE ARBITRATOR ALSO SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO PRESIDE OVER CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, OR TO AWARD ANY FORM OF CLASSWIDE OR COLLECTIVE REMEDY. INSTEAD, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE POWER TO AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NO AAA OR BBB RULE WILL APPLY IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION IN THE AAA OR BBB RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE BOUND TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY RELIEF THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SUCH LAWS.\n\nIF EITHER PARTY INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO VERIZON SHOULD BE SENT TO NOTICEOFDISPUTE@VERIZON.COM OR TO VERIZON DISPUTE RESOLUTION MANAGER, ONE VERIZON WAY, VC52N061, BASKING RIDGE, NJ 07920. THE NOTICE MUST DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 30 DAYS, EITHER PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION. VERIZON WILL PAY ANY FILING FEE THAT THE AAA OR BBB CHARGES THE CUSTOMER FOR ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE. IF THE CUSTOMER PROVIDES A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE THAT HE/SHE CANNOT PAY THE FILING FEE, VERIZON WILL PAY THE FEE DIRECTLY TO THE AAA OR BBB. IF THAT ARBITRATION PROCEEDS, VERIZON WILL ALSO PAY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED LATER, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPEAL TO A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS (IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS APPEALABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT).\n\nVERIZON MAY, BUT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE ARBITRATION BEGINS. THE AMOUNT OR TERMS OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL AFTER THE ARBITRATOR ISSUES AN AWARD ON THE CLAIM. IF THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT ACCEPT THE OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS THE CUSTOMER AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS MORE THAN OUR OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5000, OR IF VERIZON DOES NOT MAKE AN OFFER, AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS THE CUSTOMER ANY\n\nAMOUNT OF MONEY BUT LESS THAN $5000, THEN VERIZON AGREES TO PAY YOU\n\n$5000 INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE VERIZON ALSO AGREES TO PAY ANY REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW REQUIRES IT FOR THE CASE. IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS THE CUSTOMER MORE THAN $5000, THEN WE WILL PAY THAT AMOUNT TO THE CUSTOMER.\n\nAN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CANNOT BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.\n\nIF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.\n\nIF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\n\n11. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nIn the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain such invalid or unenforceable provision. Verizon shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations if such delay or nonperformance arises in connection with any acts of God, fires, floods, strikes, or other labor disputes, unusually severe weather, acts of any governmental body, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Verizon.\n\n12.

      "content": "# The Liam Project: Putting technology to work for pre-term babies and their families\n\n## At the age of 11, Chloe Gibson envisioned a way to help grieving parents separated from their premature babies stay constantly connected.\n\n\nAfter nine long months, every parent can agree there is no greater joy than the birth of a healthy, full-term baby. But when a child arrives too soon and faces life-threatening complications that delay the homecoming, there is no greater pain than that of being separated.\n\nTwo years ago, 11-year-old Chloe Gibson witnessed this firsthand when her baby brother Liam—born prematurely at 28 weeks and weighing only 1 lb. 12 oz.—was unable to go home with Chloe’s mother Mary Lewis, who was devastated. Watching her cry day after day and wanting to relieve her mom from the pain of not being able to be with Liam at the hospital, Chloe went to work, putting into practice the skills she had developed while attending a Verizon Innovative Learning STEM enrichment program for rural girls. Held during summer in collaboration with educational institutions, the immersive STEM-focused program inspired the 11-year-old problem solver to create The Liam Project. Designed with her mother in mind but knowing that many families go through the same heartbreaking experience, Chloe hopes it will give parents and caregivers a constant connection to their little one along with peace of mind.\n\nNow 13 years old, Chloe is making promising progress on the project named after her little brother, a healthy and happy 2 year old.\n\n## How it works\n\nA camera is mounted on the hospital incubator where the baby is placed. Parents and caregivers, including health professionals, can download the dedicated Liam Project app to a smartphone, tablet or desktop and view live footage of the baby in a neonatal intensive care unit in real time 24 hours a day. Monitors attached to the baby collect important data, which is also relayed in real time to provide vital information and milestones at every step of the way. Chloe also envisions a feature enabling direct messaging for nurses and other healthcare providers to help alleviate the stress of not knowing how a baby’s doing when out of their sight.\n\nChloe certainly possesses the characteristics of an entrepreneur and a leader. She’s not only curious but also able to apply critical thinking to big problems, recognizing a need and finding a solution.\n\n“I felt really empowered by the all-girls Verizon Innovative Learning camp,” she says. “I appreciated watching them all kind of share their own stories and struggles they had been through and making a project out of it — thinking of ways they can solve these issues that many people go through every day.”\n\nAs for her mom, she says she was blown away by her daughter’s actions. “I was just very humbled, and I’m so proud of her, that she would want to take something that happened to us and make it better for others.”\n\nIn 2019, the year Liam was born, 1 in 10 babies in the United States were premature, arriving before 37 weeks of pregnancy had been completed. According to the CDC, the earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of serious disability or death. Short-term complications include problems affecting the heart, brain, lungs, immune system, intestines, blood and metabolism, while long-term complications can lead to cerebral palsy, hearing and vision impairment and developmental delays among other issues. One of the best ways to decrease the chances of a pre-term delivery is by understanding common contributing risk factors and eliminate early in the pregnancy any that pose a threat.\n\nTo learn more about Verizon Innovative Learning, visit: https://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/digital-inclusion/verizon-innovative-learning",

      "content": "# Because\n\nwe can.\n\n### By Ray Roa\n\nRay Roa writes about music in beautiful Tampa, Florida. His work has appeared in Creative Loafing, Tampa Bay Times, Daily Beast and Consequence of Sound.\n\nHow this STEM program is empowering boys to put their world-changing ideas into action.\n\nJean Nicoleau talked about her student, **Tyghe Crocket-Arias**, and the transformation he underwent after his first summer with Verizon Innovative Learning as if she was describing two different people. One version of Tyghe had an energy and attitude that was disruptive at times. Prior to Verizon Innovative Learning, Nicoleau had known Tyghe for several years and watched him struggle in school. During this past school year, his grades, confidence and sense of responsibility all improved. New Tyghe was someone with a purpose and someone teachers wanted in their classrooms.\n\nTyghe returned to Verizon Innovative Learning as one of more than 60 boys accepted to participate in a three-week immersive program held at Florida International University (FIU) in Miami. It’s one of 29 such programs occurring across the U.S. this summer geared at reaching African-American and Hispanic middle school boys.\n\nStudents in the program are given access to world-class technology—from 3D printers to autonomous robots to drones—and asked to solve some of the globe’s biggest problems. It’s all part of the Verizon Innovative Learning mission to provide free technology, free internet access and hands-on learning experiences to under-resourced students to help them get the skills they need to succeed in a digital world.\n\nNow in its second summer at FIU, the program not only increases students’ ability with math and science, according to a 2017 study of program participants, but also motivates the young men to a new kind of confidence that carries into the school year; putting the boys on a path to build brighter futures. They are in a better position to change the outcomes of their own generation, and the ones that follow them. When asked about why they believe they can change the world, participants like Jonathan Montero, British Wilkerson and Gideon Joseph all had the same response: “Because we can.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“We have the power to help others.”\n\nThis is what **Jonathan Montero,** 7th grade, said as he sat just a few feet from a 3D printer that will take his design for a spoon to assist tremor patients and turn it into a prototype for his team’s STEM project. Like the rest of the boys in the program, Montero was bused in from a surrounding Miami neighborhood and fed a free breakfast before the day began.\n\nAt home, Montero—who is the son of Puerto Rican and Dominican parents—used to watch his abuelo (“grandpa”) struggle to eat as his hands shook from tremors. The program let Montero get his own hands on technology not readily available at school, and now he’s the president of his after school robotics club. Being in close contact with the tools for three weeks changed Jonathan’s outlook on how he can create positive change for patients like his grandpa. “The [program] helps us turn our ideas into a real life thing.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“It's just a different level.”\n\n**Marilyn Dieppa**, an instructor at the program, spoke about the tools that Verizon Innovative Learning exposes the boys to. Some of the boys may have been aware of the technology, and some maybe even dabbled in it, but none of them had experienced this much activity packed into such a compact frame of time.\n\nThe program’s structure—which incorporates an element of competitiveness—allowed the boys’ confidence to bloom with each successful attempt at solving complex robotic and coding problems. It encouraged shy boys to come out of their shells and work with others on projects they could not complete alone.\n\n“The structure is essential, and it’s engaging,” she said. “When the kids engage in the learning environment, they engage elsewhere.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“I need to help them.”\n\nOne of the boys who engaged well beyond the borders of the program is 13-year-old **British Wilkerson.** Troubleshooting the 3D printer or autonomous robots was the game-changer that helped British adopt the belief that he has the ability to turn designs in his head into tangible, real world solutions.\n\nHe preferred the program’s collaborative, hands-on approach to problem solving over the instruction he gets at school, but he was also focused on the challenge that waited for him once it was done. “I’m going to Puerto Rico on a trip to help my family with hurricane relief. I can build simple structures,” he said. “I need to help them.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“We should be working to help others.”\n\n**Gideon Joseph**, whose parents are Dominican, also spoke about the maladies of the modern world but his observations and the program’s\n\nintensive curriculum birthed a question inside of his own consciousness. “There are so many negative things… so I wonder. ‘Why are we trying to help ourselves?’” he said. “We should be working to help others.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“It was life-changing.”\n\nGideon’s STEM project turned food waste into electricity, and his eyes lit up when a similar project came up in the Flying Classroom lecture. **Captain Barrington Irving**—a Miami boy who grew up under the shadows of the very planes flying over campus—shared observations from his own world travels. At the age of 23, Irving went on a 97-day, 30,000-mile journey that made him the youngest person and the first African-American pilot to fly solo around the world in a single engine airplane.\n\nLike many of these boys, Irving had aspirations of being a professional athlete, but one encounter with a pilot changed his idea of what he could become if he pursued a career in STEM.\n\nImmersing middle school boys in an environment filled with STEM curriculum and like-minded explorers creates a more open mindset, and it’s the greatest benefit of Verizon Innovative Learning according to Irving. ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“They can change the world.”\n\n**Monique Ross**, a researcher and assistant professor of computer science at FIU, said that it’s paramount to maintain unique pathways to STEM after the summer program, so her student-mentors see the boys several times throughout the school year as part of the Verizon Innovative Learning initiative. Ross’ study of the student-mentors after the program’s first summer revealed an increased desire to participate in altruistic opportunities, with some saying that the life-changing experience inspired them to take more command of their own lives and also better influence the lives of future generations.\n\nThe boys are shown that they can achieve lofty goals when they set a plan, execute, refine and repeat. Armed with minimal resources, the boys solve simple dilemmas—like helping tired parents care for younger siblings—all the time when they’re not at the program or school.\n\nBeing at FIU showed the boys that their inherent problem-solving skills could also land them jobs and give them opportunities to change the world. It also challenged them to change their approach to school. ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“He did a complete 180.”\n\nJean Nicoleau, chaperone and teacher, said this about one of her students, T**yghe Crocket-Arias**. Nicoleau has known Tyghe for several years and watched him struggle through the sixth grade before going to Verizon Innovative Learning in between seventh and eighth grades. The transformation was nearly tangible.\n\n“He was like, ‘You know, I gotta get my act together,’\" Jean said, adding that Tyghe stopped taking nonsense from kids who act up in class (the very type of kid Tyghe was before the program). “He became a leader instead of that kid in the classroom. Academically his grades shot up because he feels like he's accomplishing it on his own. The teachers, they talk about how much Tyghe's group is goofy, but does well academically.\n\nHe was the first one asking about getting a spot saved for [the program].”\n\nTyghe, who is of Brazilian descent, helped some of the first year students in the program with their own struggles and created an environment that embraces learning. “I encourage them to be more brave,” Tyghe said of the shy boys. “[Just] say your questions.”\n\nNicoleau has even been able to use statistics to get Tyghe thinking outside of his dream of being a basketball player. He’s got a “better chance of getting struck by lightning,” so she and Tyghe started to think about where he can take an interest in math, possible careers and magnet schools. “So there he is at a magnet fair talking to schools, weighing the pros and the cons,” Nicoleau said.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\n“I have a belief that I can do it.”\n\nAnother transformation happened within **Justin Teodoro,** who was a shy, quiet kid at school. In his second year in the program, Justin came out of his shell during the program last year and has grown into a more confident person who leads his peers during activities like 3D printing.\n\nThe program has even taught Justin to work through the more complex problems that the robotics exercises present. “I use my mind to fix problems that I have,” he said. “If something gets hard then I stop for a minute, and then go back and then take my time. I have a belief that I can do it.” ♦\n\n## Because\n\nthey can.\n\n(Photos: Octavio Jones)\n\nSowing those slivers of self-confidence is just part of what Verizon Innovative Learning does for these middle-school boys as they enter the most crucial stages of their development.\n\n“Right now is that critical pathway, they aren't completely deciding, but they are eliminating career options,” Ross said, reiterating that most of these boys solve problems every day. “STEM jobs just mean that you love to solve problems.”\n\nThe informal learning environment, where mistakes are embraced and corrected through practice, let the boys further develop their problem-solving skills in a hands-on setting that exposed them to groundbreaking technology.\n\nAt Verizon Innovative Learning, STEM and the countless mini-victories the boys create for themselves, became the norm. A new world of possibilities was opened when they set their hands on the robotics and 3D printers. Captain Barrington Irving illustrated it best when asked about what his own peers thought when he expressed an interest in flying airplanes.\n\n“The first thing they said to me? ‘Black people don't fly planes,’” Irving said. The idea wasn’t even on his football teammates’ radars because they’d never been exposed to it despite living just two miles from an airport runway.\n\n“So to submerse a child in an environment where you have other like-minded explorers around STEM — because that's what these kids are doing, they're exploring — it's significant because now what you've created is an environment of free thinking. STEM becomes the norm. The things that Verizon engineers and technologists do every day — that's normal. You want to cultivate that.”\n\nThose seeds were planted at the Verizon Innovative Learning program. They were cared for and sent out to walk around the world hand-in-hand with the idea that the solutions to the globe’s biggest problems are just around the corner. These boys left FIU believing that they are going to change the world.\n\nBecause they can.",

      "content": "# Real talk about toddlers and screens\n\n## 5 ways I navigate tech with my 2-year-old.\n\n\nWay back in 2012, I shared my first Instagram post. It’s a photo of my wife wearing an “I voted” sticker, just after we hit the ballot box. I never imagined that, seven years later, I’d be posting photos of our daughter in a tutu. But, here she is, my whole world wrapped up in a tiny pink leotard.\n\nTechnology is a part of every day life with Kendrick—even as a two-year-old. And, frankly, that terrifies me. Like a lot of people, I have a complicated relationship with technology. It helps me do my job better, allows me to communicate and share ideas with people I may have never met, and even helped me ask my wife out for the first time (it was a Facebook DM). But, if I’m struggling with over-connectivity as an adult, how am I supposed to strike the right balance for my toddler?\n\nKendrick’s part of a generation that’s been plugged in since birth. Since before birth, actually: We used an app to track her growth in utero, switched to a connected baby monitor the first year and now post photos and videos of her on social media. Like many parents, it’s a big part of our lives. And so I try to approach each of these aspects of her life with some mindfulness, understanding the benefits and pitfalls of each.\n\nTo help find my way, I sat down with Dr. Devorah Heitner to discuss the five biggest areas where technology and Kendrick’s life intersect. Devorah is a renowned thought leader and author of “Screenwise: Helping Kids Survive (and Thrive) in their Digital World.” She founded Raising Digital Natives, an online resource for tackling all things related to kids and screens. Devorah’s also a parent herself. As we spoke, much of her advice felt like conversations I’ve had at the playground with other parents. Her relaxed approach put me at ease and reassured me that these are questions that we’re all facing together.\n\n#### 1. FaceTime can keep us connected.\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\nMy job takes me to faraway places, usually for a week at a time. I love the work, and experiencing other parts of the world is a beautiful thing. But it’s not easy on my family. During those weeks, my wife is left to handle things alone with Kendrick. And there are times I come home and I can feel how the time away has impacted my relationship with my daughter. I’d come through the door with my arms open and she’d barely look up at me. When she was an infant, a week was such a long time. She was a different girl by the time I came home—developmental leaps were happening all the time.\n\nBut I began to notice that FaceTime was really helping us stay connected while I was on the road. She’d see my face and we’d talk about her day. My wife would facilitate the conversation: “Tell Dada what you did today at school.” We’d kiss each other goodbye in this big exaggerated way by opening our mouths wide in front of the camera before smacking a giant kiss. And when I would come home, it felt more seamless. We stayed connected.\n\nDevorah’s insight:* “**We know that kids, even in the womb, hear their parent's voices and know their parent's voices. So, it would make sense that even just hearing your voice would kind of keep you in the loop in her brain. The American Academy of Pediatricians does recommend FaceTime with grandparents and other far away family as one of the best uses for screen time for younger kids.”*\n\n#### 2. The smartband: Like puppies, tech gifts for kids warrant a conversation.\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\nMy brother-in-law gave Kendrick a smartband as a gift. It freaked me out. It just didn’t seem like an age-appropriate gift and I felt a loss of control over her relationship with screens. The smartband is pretty harmless, actually. There’s a camera that takes photos and video. There are some games and songs. But, it does bring up this issue of control. When Kendrick is at daycare, is she getting screen time? She spends one day a week with my parents. What’s happening there with screens? It called to mind a lot of questions for me, from managing gifts to setting digital boundaries with loved ones.\n\nDevorah’s insight:* “Anytime someone gifts your kid a tech item, it's like gifting a puppy. Ideally, they should be asking permission and collaborating with the parents. As parents, you're the ones who have to deal with it. Would your parents get your kid a puppy and say, ‘Good luck?’ Who's going to walk that puppy? It shouldn't be an executive decision from grandma that your kid has a new smartphone, for example.”*\n\n#### 3. To app or not to app: Some simulation is okay.\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\nKendrick has already developed a very serious interest in ballet. She loves the tutus and the slippers and the regalia. So, we recently enrolled her in a class. At home, we’ll play videos of ballet companies performing Swan Lake. And we’ve recently found a ballet teacher who instructs young viewers from a digital studio. Kendrick stands in front of the screen and mirrors the teacher’s movements: Follows along from plie, to tendu, to arabesque.\n\nDevorah’s insight:* “**An app developer I really like for her age group is **Toca Boca**. They have a pet hairstyling salon, and a cooking app, and an app where you can do science in the lab. I love Toca Boca, but if I had to choose between my kid going to a petting zoo and meeting an actual sheep and playing with Toca Boca apps, I'd probably take them to meet the sheep. But you could do both. Most kids are not going to be having nonstop outdoor experiences and there are going to be times where you just need her to be doing something while you make dinner. And maybe an educational app is a good thing.”*\n\n#### 4. Streaming movies and shows: Good content is out there.\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\nI know kids Kendrick’s age who don’t watch movies and shows. Not many, but I know some. We started streaming shows and movies early with Kendrick. But, my wife and I are pretty discerning about what kind of content that should be. And really, Kendrick is her own barometer. She’s great at telling us, “This is scary.” Or, “I don’t like that man,” when a villain appears on screen. We try to stay away from fast-moving visuals, and violence, of course, and plot lines that reinforce negative stereotypes of women or people of color. It’s not easy to find good content for her age, but there are some great shows out there that she loves, and we love them too, like “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” “Tumble Leaf,” and “Luo Bao Bei.”\n\nDevorah’s insight: “*One resource that you might want to look at is **amightygirl.com**. It has a lot of great show recommendations with really positive roles for both boys and girls. And I know I look at that with my son. He watches all these superhero shows. He's much older than your kiddo, but I'm always looking for things that might be a little bit of an alternative to that. The Japanese animation movies, like some of the Miyazaki films, have really wonderful girl heroes and they actually are really into nature, too.”*\n\n#### 5. Social media: Share in moderation and think about how it could affect her as an adult.\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\nFor the first year of Kendrick’s life, my wife and I would freely post about her on social media. In fact, that’s one way we announced her birth. I remember that Instagram post. But, as Kendrick has gotten older, she has become more aware of the camera and sometimes she’ll even tell me, “Don’t take my picture, Dad!” The first time it happened, it really shook me up. She was barely two years old and was already demonstrating to me issues of privacy. Since that moment, my wife and I have really dialed back when posting about her. Instead, I try to stay present in the moment. Or, if I do capture some amazing footage of her, I’ll share it with the family group text, rather than social media.\n\nDevorah’s insight:* “When she's old enough to understand, I would ask her permission. But, for now, think about her as a self-conscious 13 year old. Think of her as a 40 year old running for head of the board or even president. What will people say about the things you've posted?*\n\n*“If she’s telling you not to take her photo, that's a good time to maybe cut down. Don't bring your camera everywhere, which means put your phone in your pocket.** We have these devices with us that our parents didn't have. So, when we were at the playground, our parents didn't take our picture. And, you know, we still have enough documentation of our childhood.”*\n\nDevorah’s realistic approach to technology and children was a bit of a relief. I feel at almost every turn my instincts as a father are right on. I’ve learned that much of the technology Kendrick encounters can create wonderful opportunities for discovery, education and even connection. So, rather than being fearful of it all, I’m choosing to become empowered. I can lean into the technology and help Kendrick develop a healthy relationship with these tools. At the end of the day, I have to trust myself, my family and my community, and know that she’s going to be okay.",

      "content": "# Once upon an Instagram live…\n\n## How mobile tech inspired these sisters to write their own book series—and how their mom is finding balance and boundaries along the way.\n\n\nWhen the phone alarm goes off at 8 PM, the girls have 30 minutes to get ready for a bedtime story. And Hailey doesn’t like to be late.\n\nThe little reading nook in the dining room used to be the family’s craft corner, but now the cubbies hold a small library of books, stacked and grouped by color. “Women who read, lead,” is written in neat cursive on the nearby toy kitchen fridge. On a carpet with a cartoon illustration of the world, the girls get set up: a pillow poof to sit on, a step stool, laptop, and a ring light with a smartphone holder made specifically for video bloggers. They open the laptop, tap the phone, and they’re live.\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\n“Hey beautiful people. I’m Hailey. Thank you for joining us,” says Hailey, looking into the laptop camera. “Go ahead and hit that share button and remember to show love by liking or loving this video.”\n\nFor sisters Hailey and Zaria, this is the new “once upon a time.” On weeknights they livestream their bedtime stories for children who may not have the luxury—or parents who may just need a break.\n\n“I'm still wrapping my head around it,” their mother Victoria says. Early on, she wasn’t sure about her girls being on social media. “They asked me a million times,” Victoria says. “Like really.”\n\nBy 8:30 PM, with any luck and without technical glitches, Hailey at age 8 and Zaria at age 13 read a bedtime story over Facebook and Instagram Live. “Our main purpose is to read a book of our choice each night at a designated time so that children can have a bedtime story each night,” the Facebook page says about the story time.\n\nThey started reading books live in March to a handful of viewers, mostly their mother Victoria, and their 14-month-old twin girls Harlow and Harper, who watched upstairs from their phones during bath time. Now, the most-watched story on their Facebook page is 13,000 viewers. The Facebook page has over 10,000 likes and is growing. They started a YouTube channel, and the girls are reading to raise money to buy books for a library in Ghana, West Africa.\n\n“Now I watch them when they're in their room on the floor like, ‘Oh we should do this next. And we should work on doing this and this.’ “ Victoria says about how the livestream has inspired the girl’s creativity and collaboration offline, too. “And they'll talk to me like, ‘Mom, what if we got connected with other schools to build libraries.’ So we've been in contact with the police department, the YMCA, the school district, trying to see which schools have the most needs.”\n\n#### Once upon an idea\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\nEach summer, Victoria, a professional organizer, asks the girls to do a summer project, such as start a lemonade stand or help a neighbor do laundry. Earlier this spring, the girls were thinking about what to do for the summer project when they got the idea.\n\n“Well, every night we don't go to bed immediately,” says Hailey, “but we brainstorm and talk to each other as we're going to sleep.”\n\n“We were specifically talking that night about what we were going to do with our summer,” Zaria says. “Because we didn't want it to be like every other summer. We wanted to do something important. Then, we started talking about how some kids don't get the luxury to be read to. Then, we were like, you know what, we're going to read to kids this summer.”\n\nVictoria wasn’t convinced.\n\n“I thought, are people even reading books anymore?” Victoria says about her response when the girls first brought her the idea. “‘Who's going to be watching you? What's your audience?’ And they were like, ‘Mom, it's going to be great. Parents are going to log in for their kids.’”\n\n#### Raising a digital parent takes a village\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\n“I’m in a million mommy groups,” Victoria says about raising her kids in a digital age. She has five children: Hal is 15, Hailey and Zaria, 5-year-old Harrison, and the twins Harper and Harlow. She looks for help online, finds things on Pinterest and talks to moms with older kids.\n\nZaria got her first flip phone last year, and her first smartphone this year.\n\n“The reason I like [the smartphone] is because I can limit everything,” Victoria says. “I can control the whole phone from my phone.” Zaria can use social media and watch YouTube for 30 minutes to an hour every evening, then she shuts it down. When Victoria gets home from work in the evenings, she turns off WiFi or changes the password until the girls do a few tasks.\n\nZaria also has a phone contract with Victoria. She turns off the phone at 9 PM each night. The phone goes away during family dinners. In the morning, the girls need to stick to their morning routines to keep using the tech. For Zaria, she meditates with affirmations three to five minutes every morning to help her get her day started right.\n\n“Just things like that, they let me know when they’ve become very responsible,” Victoria says about the girls using digital technology.\n\n#### Live from Dover, Delaware\n\nOnce Victoria agreed, Zaria got to work setting up the tech—she’s the tech whiz in the family. In those first couple of weeks, there were only two viewers, with Victoria being one of them.\n\n“And they didn't get discouraged,” Victoria says. “Even though they had nobody watching some nights, they kept doing it.”\n\nWhen Victoria realized how serious they were about it, Victoria got serious about it, too.\n\n“When I get off work from my nine to five, I come home and they're my five to nine,” she says.\n\nEarly on, Victoria thought it would be good for the girls to interact with the comments, but when a few weird comments turned up, she decided to have them turn off the computer as soon as they’re done reading.\n\n“They know to shut the laptop down, bring it to my room, and I go back through and I'll respond,” Victoria says.\n\n“I want to protect my babies,” Victoria says. “I always tell them, when you do something online, think about how it would look three or four years from now. Every decision you make, it needs to be a future decision. Not a right-now decision.”\n\n#### Parenting online begins offline\n\n“This, for me, you know, is digital parenting at its finest: Where parents bring those experiences and that maturity and those thought processes from the offline world into the online world,” says digital parenting coach and consultant Elizabeth Milovidov. Based in Paris, France, Milovidov helps parents around the world learn how to raise their kids in the digital age.\n\nEven with the risks associated with digital exposure, Milovidov stresses the importance of learning through those concerns to give children a creative experience—especially when it’s being used to facilitate positive change.\n\nToday’s kids are more primed than ever to be social media influencers. In a recent survey of children ages eight to 12, the most sought-after job for kids in the US and UK was being a vlogger or YouTuber.\n\n“And they can ask questions and they can help their children,” Milovidov says about parents on the learning curve with digital technology. “They can provide answers that are based on their own experiences. And that is the best way to support a child. In fact, a lot of the times that children do get into trouble, it's because they didn't realize they had someone they could go to.”\n\n#### And they all wrote happily ever after\n\nNow, with a few months of story time in the books, the girls have five pre-recorded stories on reserve in case the family is running late, wants to do something else or someone isn’t feeling well.\n\n“I don’t want them to feel restricted to being home at a certain time to go live,” Victoria says. “We don’t try to confine our time to be at home so we can do our outdoor things.\n\nIn recent weeks, children’s book authors have been reaching out to the girls, asking if they’d read one of their books live. Zaria’s favorite author, April Henry, a young adult crime novelist, wrote to thank her for reviewing her book Girl, Stolen and sent her a signed copy of her new book.\n\nThe girls are also writing a story series of their own about growing up in a blended family called Mixed, Matched and All That. Their oldest brother, Hal lives in Mississippi and he’s illustrating the stories. He’ll text pictures of the drawings to the girls and they’ll video chat on their phones to art direct the images. Zaria is writing the first story in the series: “Me, Myself and Mommy.”\n\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell\n\n“I don’t really know how to explain it, but we’re just making a book,” Zaria says about the process. “It's about all of our lives, but it starts off with me. She helped me a little bit on this one,” Zaria says, looking at Hailey.\n\n“I just help her when she doesn't write it right,” Hailey says.\n\n#### Parents corner\n\nIs your child thinking about using social media for the greater good? Most social media apps prohibit children under the age of 13 from using the platforms, but with parental engagement and direction, you can help protect and nurture your child’s interests.\n\nClose the comment sections.\n\nMilovidov suggests turning off the comments feature since it sometimes attracts inappropriate content. But, if someone clicks the thumbs down or dislike on the video, use it as a teaching opportunity, Moilovidov says. Just like one sister might like macaroni and cheese, but the other doesn’t, that doesn’t make the mac and cheese bad—it simply means that not everybody likes everything.\n\nBrush up on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission recently fined YouTube and Google $170 million for collecting personal information from viewers of child-directed channels, particularly shows created for children.\n\nDress appropriately.\n\nWith respect to audiences around the world who may be watching, dressing appropriately also shows respect for the people and the other viewers who may be watching.\n\nConsider the siblings.\n\nNot every child wants to be online. But, if other siblings are getting bullied or feeling left out, get ready for the conversation.\n\nRead the terms and conditions on social platforms.\n\nThink like a digital guardian. Understand the copyright and intellectual property rights you surrender when you publish images online. For example, once photos are uploaded to Facebook, you give Facebook and other platforms a license to use them.\n\nKnow your safety centers.\n\nThese social platforms each have some safety options. Explore those pages to know how to report and block aggressive users. “Obviously, there will be things happening where people do and say things,” Milovidov says. “But, again, you can also use those things at teaching moments and guide children in how to use technology responsibly.”\n\nPhoto credit: Ryan Donnell",

      "content": "# How to set house rules for multiplayer VR games\n\n## Apply parental control settings to headsets and teach kids how to spot toxic game behavior in multiplayer VR games. A gamer, IT professor and dad shows you how.\n\n\nMy family is fully immersed in virtual reality—and as a parent, I have a responsibility to monitor what’s happening in my kids’ VR headsets as they play multiplayer VR games.\n\nI’m a gaming and IT professor, and parent to three boys, and we have two Meta Oculus Quest headsets in our house. My sons’ friends come by every day to play VR games—and sometimes their gaming includes other people wearing VR headsets in other parts of the world. But it gets tricky when visiting kids have different house rules (or none at all) for multiplayer VR games.\n\nAs parents, we need to talk with our kids about how to play it safe in VR, and we also need to talk to other parents about what’s OK at their houses.\n\nHere’s how to start the conversations with your kids, their friends and their friends’ parents about how to keep kids safe when playing multiplayer VR games.\n\n## What makes a game multiplayer?\n\nMultiplayer games are played simultaneously by more than one player. Players can be in the same room or in different parts of the world. Among VR games, the most popular are multiplayer VR games, as well as free games with options to buy additional features in the games. You can play along with a dedicated VR headset, like the Meta Quest, or convert your phone to a VR headset.\n\n## How do you prevent your kids from playing unsafe games on VR?\n\nFirst, learn how to use parental controls on your VR headsets. The Meta Quest headset, for example, offers parents controls that can be set via an app on your phone.\n\nHere are steps you can take to help keep multiplayer VR gaming safer.\n\nDownload the VR’s headset app to your phone, go to the parental supervision menu and connect it to the VR headset. If your teen has the headset app downloaded to their phone, they can send you an invitation to connect to their app, or you can send them an invitation from the app on your phone.\n\nFrom the VR headset app on your phone, you can see what games they’re playing, monitor or restrict in-game purchases, and block VR games.\n\nFrom the app on your phone, monitor the amount of time they spend with their multiplayer VR games. As of this writing, you can’t limit how long they can play.\n\nMonitor who they play with. From the VR app on your phone, you can see who they’re playing with and who they’ve messaged in the game. However, the friends list only shows usernames, not real names. Ask them if they know who those people are and if they know them in real life. I suggest that younger teens only play with the friends that you both know.\n\n\nContent and age restrictions are only a guide to help you select age-appropriate games for your child. A game rated E for everyone may not necessarily be safe for every kid.\n\n## How to talk to your kids about how to stay safe in multiplayer VR games\n\nYou’ve probably talked with your kids about good manners at the dinner table or good sportsmanship on the court. The same rules apply to good gaming sportsmanship in multiplayer VR games.\n\nExplain toxic behavior—such as aggressive behavior or language —and how to deal with toxic people in a multiplayer chat, as your child could encounter aggressive, overly competitive language.\n\nTeach your kids how to use the mute feature so they can mute toxic players in the game itself. They’ll need to apply the mute setting in the game from the headset, not the app.\n\nReport inappropriate players. This needs to happen during the game. The other player won’t know they’ve been reported until the game is finished. Reporting a player doesn’t mean they’re banned from a game right away. A person may need to be reported 20 times before they’re banned. It’s all monitored by artificial intelligence, and mistakes happen all time.\n\nGet in the habit of asking them about what happened in the game. They may refuse initially but may come back to talk about it later.\n\n\n## Safe multiplayer VR games for kids\n\nWhat’s considered an appropriate game varies from family to family. Some of the more popular multiplayer VR games at my house are Fruit Ninja, Beat Saber, Job Simulator, Angry Birds, Gorilla Tag, Rec Room and Roblox.\n\nSet time limits for VR play and balance it with other forms of media and outdoor play. My kids exercise one hour outdoors for every hour they play online. For younger kids, I suggest taking a break every 30 minutes.\n\n## How to talk with other parents about what’s safe to play\n\nAsk other parents if they monitor their kids’ VR gaming. Parents often share similar thoughts and may feel overwhelmed when it comes to determining what games are appropriate. Here are tips to start that conversation:\n\nAsk parents about their child’s VR gaming habits. Find out what games they allow, how they supervise them and whether they set time limits. Every parent will have their own set of boundaries, and it’s important to start talking about what those are.\n\nTalk to parents of kids with older siblings and ask them how they’ve handled it. They’ve already been dealing with these situations and may have some good advice.\n\nTalk with your child’s teacher. Schools are teaching kids to identify inappropriate games and how to handle toxic behavior online. Ask how they’re talking with kids about it, and how to bring that conversation to other parents.\n\n\nNavigating this technological world is a community effort, so reach out to other parents, teachers and mentors for support. It truly takes a village, and it’s only getting more complicated as the technology behind multiplayer VR games advances—and that makes this all the more challenging. But both kids and adults can have a good time with multiplayer VR games, and taking some time to set it up can help ensure a positive experience for your child. And have fun!\n\nHelp your child develop healthy habits for their digital life. Check out the Verizon Smart Family app.",

Today, it’s a tool for connection, education and even wellness, with programs designed for everything from mindfulness and mental health support to accessibility for people of all abilities. As headsets evolve to offer more than just entertainment, families are finding new ways to use VR to learn, bond and explore together.\n\nIf you’re considering adding a VR headset to your household, here’s what you need to know.\n\n## Choosing the best VR headsets for kids\n\nVirtual reality hardware usually includes a headset, motion-tracking sensors and cameras, hand controllers, and sometimes also built-in headphones and speakers that create 3D sound effects.\n\nThese headsets are just one of several gateways to the metaverse, a virtual reality space where users, typically in the form of digital avatars, can interact with other users and computer-generated environments. When you’re wearing a VR headset, it can feel as if you’re s on a roller coaster, walking through the streets of Rome or skiing down a mountain slope.\n\nVR headsets also offer access to a world of music, movies, games and multi-player social experiences. Some, though not all, headsets come with built-in parental controls, which can limit access to inappropriate content, connectivity options, log-in times and more.\n\nGenerally speaking, most VR headsets are not designed for children under the age of 13, and there’s a variety of reasons: A child’s eyesight is still developing; VR can make even some adults feel motion sickness; and there’s not enough research yet about the long-term effects for children. So, look for the recommended age ranges on the box. These product-based age ratings simply provide a helpful snapshot of which age groups the manufacturer has designed the product for.\n\n**Quick tips:**\n\n- Follow the product guidelines. Most VR headsets are not designed for children under the age of 13.\n- Teens should follow the 20-20-20 rule anytime they use screens, including VR: Take a 20-second break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away.\n- Review the product’s health and safety guidelines.\n\n## Setting up a VR space\n\nMany VR headsets recommend that a VR room or play space should be an open area at least 6.5 feet by 6.5 feet that’s free of furniture or clutter that headset users could bump into or trip over. They also suggest setting up these play spaces away from doorways, walls and staircases. While you’re immersed in these high-tech worlds, virtual reality experiences can leave you unaware of surrounding real-world objects.\n\nConsider allowing gamers 5 – 10 minutes to orient themselves to new play areas and get a sense of their positioning in the room before starting the game. You might also consider standing by and watching kids as they get started to make sure that your VR room is ready for prime time.\n\n**Quick tips:**\n\n- Set up a VR play space that’s free from clutter or furniture.\n- Play indoors.\n- Some VR headsets suggest you set up a virtual space or a virtual game board.\n- Avoid areas with staircases.\n- Plan to watch a few rounds with your kids to make sure the play space is safe.\n- Consider using a device to cast the gameplay onto a TV, so you can also monitor what’s happening in the headset.\n\n## Virtual reality games for kids: How to choose age-appropriate apps\n\nKeep an eye on content and age ratings when selecting single-player and multi-player VR apps. It’s important for families to discuss what types of VR content, such as cartoon violence, crude humor, etc., are okay for kids to consume, too. These ratings are generally listed alongside the product description in the online store, but they’re not all clearly labeled. If kids have questions or encounter something inappropriate, encourage them to ask you about it.\n\nAs with any high-tech offering, VR games for kids can be designed around a variety of themes: Some are positive and uplifting, and others play to more adult topics. Steer children toward virtual reality offerings that teach them about real-world subjects, such as science, math, technology, travel and experiencing other cultures. And think about the kinds of experiences you want your child to avoid, such as simulated swordplay or full-body combat.\n\nIt’s also important to know the ways in which VR users can connect, communicate and consume content. As with other internet-ready devices, VR headsets for kids allow them to browse the web and speak or chat with others online, and share multimedia content, such as photos, videos, songs and films. The best VR apps and games for kids can let you play with dozens or even hundreds of others in shared spaces. Set rules, limits and guidelines with your children about what activities are appropriate to engage in and when, as well as who it’s okay to interact with and how—and be clear and consistent about how rules are enforced.\n\n**Quick tips:**\n\n- Look for games that teach about real-world subjects, such as science, math, technology, travel and experiencing other cultures.\n- Look for the VR game’s ESRB rating.\n\n## How to play it safe with VR\n\nVirtual reality will expose children to simulated experiences and interactions, so it’s important to talk through what they may encounter, how to treat others with respect and what it means to be a good digital citizen. For example, what should they do if they see something inappropriate online? They need to know that they can talk to you about what they see.\n\nTeach kids to pay attention to their moods and feelings when they’re playing. VR can sometimes feel disorienting, especially when it’s used to convey the impression that you’re standing on the edge of a cliff or the deck of a rocking ship. Kids should plan to take a 20-minute break from play to rest every 20 minutes—especially if they’re feeling anxious, wired, or like they’re experiencing headaches or motion sickness. If so, taking a brief walk outside or lying down and closing their eyes can help.\n\nWatch for children’s online purchases and buying habits in the games, too. As with smartphones and video game systems, VR headsets for kids often provide access to online stores or in-app purchases. Set boundaries with kids about buying options, monitor their purchases, and discuss these purchase options with them before they start playing.\n\nMany VR apps are designed to be deeply social and multi-player, and those interactions can be more intense, too. It’s crucial to discuss the dangers of interacting with strangers in virtual reality realms and make sure that kids know not to share personal information, such as birthdays, addresses, school info, etc., before they start exploring these simulated VR worlds.\n\nConsider turning off tracking features in the app. VR devices, games and apps are fundamentally designed to track your eye and body movements, and some software items may track your location and preferences as well. VR manufacturers and app developers may use this information for other purposes, such as marketing. Review these companies’ privacy policies to understand how they use information and what choices you have about how it’s used or shared.\n\n**Quick tips:**\n\n- Talk together about what it means to be a good digital citizen in VR games.\n- Take gameplay breaks every 20 minutes.\n- Pay attention to any physical symptoms your kids may experience when wearing a headset, and know when it’s time to take a break.\n- Monitor in-app purchases.\n- Talk together about how the game made them feel after they played it to decide if it’s something worth playing again.\n- Turn off your name, activity and friends list in the privacy settings, which can typically be found in system or app settings menus. Doing so may limit connectivity and location tracking but generally won’t detract from the overall gameplay experience.\n\nAfter all, the real beauty of VR is that it can help children see things from entirely new perspectives—both figuratively and literally. Preteens and teens also tend to exhibit a greater empathy for other individuals and an interest in exploring surrounding topics further in real-world environments.\n\nAs a result, playing with VR technology isn’t just a great way to stimulate connection and conversation. It also prompts kids’ interest in new topics and trends by letting them experience the world through others’ eyes in ways that traditional high-tech offerings simply can’t offer.\n\nGet insights about your child’s digital life with Verizon Family.\n\nVR games for kids can be designed around a variety of themes. Steer children toward games that teach them about real-world subjects, such as science, math, technology, travel and experiencing other cultures. And think about the kinds of experiences you want your child to avoid, such as simulated swordplay or full-body combat. Also, look for the game’s ESRB rating, which stands for the Entertainment Software Rating Board.\n\nAs with many connected, or real-world, experiences, kids can encounter inappropriate content. It’s important to talk with them early and often about what it means to be a good digital citizen when they’re playing a game, to watch out for bullying behavior and to know what’s considered appropriate for them. As in any online game, children should not share personal information, such as their home address or phone number online. And it’s also essential that kids pay attention to the way they feel when they’re playing in virtual worlds. If it’s an energizing, uplifting experience, ask them what they liked about it. And if they’re left feeling sluggish, irritated or tired, talk together about whether it’s an experience they’d like to continue.\n\nMost VR headsets are not made for children under the age of 13, and it’s important to choose games with the appropriate ESRB rating. Ratings are listed as E for everyone, E10+ for everyone 10 and up, T for teens ages 13 and up, M is for mature ages 17 and up, and A is for adults only, ages 18 and up.\n\nWhen shopping for a VR headset for kids, follow hardware guidelines. For example, most VR headsets are not designed for kids under the age of 13. Many virtual reality systems provide guidance on recommended user age ranges right on the box. These product-based age ratings simply provide a helpful snapshot of which age groups the manufacturer has designed the product for.\n\nAn award-winning professional speaker, Scott Steinberg is among today’s best-known trends experts and futurists.

EQUIPMENT; MAINTENANCE AND OWNERSHIP OF EQUIPMENT.\n\n(a) We do not guarantee that the Service will work correctly if you use equipment to access the Service other than the Equipment, or Other Devices authorized by Verizon for use in connection with the Service, including but not limited to smartphones, tablets, other portable devices, gaming consoles and internet-ready equipment. We have no responsibility for the operation or support, maintenance or repair of any third-party Other Devices, Other Devices that have been designated as Retired, software or services that you choose to use in connection with the Service or with the Equipment or Other Devices provided by us. We assume no responsibility for the operation of the Service if equipment other than the Equipment or Other Devices authorized by us for use in connection with the Service are used to access the Service.\n\n(b) You acknowledge and agree that at all times ownership of the Equipment shall remain with us and that this Agreement allows you to use Equipment only in connection with your receipt and use of the Service. We may, at our option, supply new or reconditioned Equipment or non-third party Other Devices to you. We will repair and maintain the Equipment owned by us at our expense, unless such repair or maintenance is made necessary due to misuse, abuse or intentional damage to the Equipment, in which case you will be financially responsible for the repair or replacement of the damaged Equipment. Except as set forth in the terms and conditions of any Verizon limited warranty applicable to Other Devices, we have no obligation to repair, replace, or maintain any such Other Devices. You also agree that the Equipment will not be serviced by anyone other than our employees or our designated agents or representatives. You further agree not to tamper with or otherwise harm the Equipment, and that you will not copy, modify, reverse compile or reverse engineer any Equipment or Other Devices, or software or firmware provided by Verizon in connection with the Service. Except as set forth below, upon termination of the Service, or if the occupancy or ownership of your Premises changes, you are responsible for returning the Equipment to us in an undamaged condition, subject only to reasonable wear and tear. Failure to return any Equipment owned by us within 30 days as instructed by Verizon, or returning Equipment in a damaged condition (subject only to reasonable wear and tear), will result in the imposition of an Equipment fee that may be substantial. If the Equipment is affixed with a label which includes the following (or similar) message, “PROPERTY OF VERIZON. DO NOT REMOVE FROM PREMISES,” then you must not remove the Equipment and you will not be charged an Equipment Fee as long as the Equipment is left in place in reasonable condition (subject only to reasonable wear and tear.)\n\n(c) In the event that any Equipment is stolen, you are required to provide us with a copy of the police report to verify that such Equipment was reported stolen. If no report is produced, then you will be held financially responsible for the stolen Equipment.\n\n(d) Fios TV Equipment and Other Devices are priced separately from the price of the Service or Bundled Services plan, and may not be subject to the price protection applicable to the Service or Bundled Services plan in a term agreement or promotional offer.\n\n(e) You may be required to pay certain Equipment-related fees, such as restocking fees and/or exchange fees.\n\n10. TERMINATION OF SERVICE; TERMINATION FEES.\n\n(a) You or Verizon may terminate the Service at any time and for any reason by giving notice to the other in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in this agreement. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, termination will be effective on the last day of that month’s billing cycle, and you are responsible for all charges incurred through the date of termination. Installation or setup fees paid at the initiation of the Service, if any, are not refundable. If a termination is a result of violation by you of the terms of this agreement, you may also be liable to pay an Early Termination Fee as set forth in Section 10(b). We may, at our sole discretion, refuse to accept your subsequent request for Service following a termination or suspension of your use of the Service. If your Service is terminated for any reason, you may be required to pay a reconnection fee or additional deposit before the Service is reactivated.\n\n(b) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO SUBSCRIBE TO A BUNDLED SERVICES PLAN WITH A MINIMUM TERM COMMITMENT, IF ANY OF THE BUNDLE SERVICES ARE TERMINATED BY YOU OR BY US BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR MINIMUM TERM, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY VERIZON THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE SET FORTH IN THE BUNDLED SERVICES PLAN YOU HAVE CHOSEN.\n\n11. PRICING AND PAYMENT.\n\nIn consideration for your receipt of the Service and use of any Equipment or Other Devices, you agree to pay us as follows:\n\n(a) Service Fees. Billing for the Service will begin automatically: (i) Upon installation of the Service if the Service is installed by Verizon or (ii) on the Due Date established by Verizon (after the Equipment, and any applicable Other Devices, has been delivered) if the Service is self-installed by you. Billing will continue until the Service is terminated in accordance with Section 10 (a) of this Agreement. You will begin receiving any discount associated with a Bundled Services plan once all the Bundled Services have been installed. Regular Service and Equipment (and, if applicable, Other Devices) charges are billed each month in advance. You agree to pay us in advance, at our rates in effect at the time, through all periods until the Service is terminated in accordance with Section 10 (a) of this Agreement. Other transactional charges, such as for On Demand or Pay Per View Services, are billed after the applicable service or feature has been ordered or provided to you. You may also be required, based on your ordering and payment history, to provide pre-billing statement payment by credit card or such other payment method as we may designate for transactional services such as On Demand or Pay Per View Services. You agree to pay all applicable charges for the Service and Equipment or Other Devices by the due date set forth in your monthly invoice. Rates for the Service and other charges (excluding charges detailed in Section 11(b) – (d)) may be changed by us at any time, subject to the provision of prior notice to you as required by law. If we provide you with notice, it will be provided as set forth in Section 14 below. Rates for On Demand and Pay Per View Services may change at any time. Your billing statement may also contain certain other charges (including, without limitation, taxes and other governmental fees, as well as charges such as franchise fees, account activation and installation charges, franchise related costs, surcharges, reactivation fees, customized setup fees, late payment charges on past-due balances, returned payment fees, Early Termination Fees and other nonrecurring charges) and you agree to pay such other charges by the due date set forth in your billing statement. The waiver of any fees or charges is at our discretion. If you cancel any component of a Bundled Services plan, the monthly charges for the remaining services on your account will automatically convert to the applicable existing non-discounted monthly service rate.\n\n(b) Plans with Minimum Terms. If you subscribe to a Bundled Services plan with a term commitment, you agree to maintain such services for the minimum term of that plan. At the end of your term, you may be given the option to select a new Bundled Services plan. If you do not select a new Bundled Services plan, your account will automatically convert to a month-to-month plan at a monthly fee that may be higher than your current rate. If you subscribe to a new Bundled Services plan, the terms of that plan will apply.\n\n(c) Third-Party Charges. You acknowledge and agree that you may incur charges with third-parties that are separate and apart from the Service Fees charged by us. These may include charges resulting from accessing online services or purchasing products and services through interactive options available through the Service, and may include additional service and data charges or fees from a wireless or internet service provider (which may be a third party or a Verizon affiliate). You are solely responsible for all charges payable to third parties or Verizon affiliates, including all applicable taxes. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.\n\n(d) Late Fees. If we do not receive your full and complete payment by the due date, we may charge you a late fee on the unpaid balance and may also terminate or suspend your Service. In the event we utilize a collection agency or resort to legal action to recover an unpaid balance, you agree to reimburse us for all expenses incurred to recover such unpaid balance, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If you fail to pay on time and Verizon refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, a collection fee will be assessed and will be due at the time of the referral to the third party. The fee will be calculated at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, not to exceed 18 percent.\n\n(e) Customer Deposits. We may require that you provide us with a refundable deposit (“Customer Deposit”) prior to or upon the activation or reactivation of the Service. We may also require an additional Customer Deposit after activation of the Service if you fail to pay any amounts when due hereunder or seek to upgrade your Service. We may apply Customer Deposits against any unpaid amounts at any time. Within ninety (90) days of termination of Service, we shall return a sum equal to the Customer Deposit, without interest unless otherwise required by law, minus any amounts due on your account including, without limitation, any amounts owed to us for unreturned or damaged Equipment.\n\n(f) Questions About Your Billing Statement. Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge on your billing statement, you must contact us within 60 days of your billing date you receive the bill in question. UNDISPUTED PORTIONS OF YOUR BILLING STATEMENT MUST BE PAID BY THE DUE DATE TO AVOID A LATE FEE AND POSSIBLE SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE.\n\n(g) Payments. Except as otherwise permitted under applicable law, you agree that you will pay your bill by check, credit or debit card, electronic funds transfer payments or such other payment method as we may designate. The outstanding balance is due in full each month. If any bank or other financial institution refuses to honor any payment, draft or instrument submitted for payment to your account, we may charge you a fee in accordance with applicable law. Based on your election and subject to our approval, Verizon or its agent will bill you directly, or bill your charge card or local Verizon telephone bill (where available). IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL, BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO HAVE ALL SERVICE CHARGES INCLUDED ON YOUR PHONE BILL. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A BUNDLED SERVICES PLAN, THEN ALL OF THE BUNDLED SERVICES MUST BE BILLED ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL.\n\n(h) Consents Regarding Credit. We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing you Service. In order to establish an account with us and/or obtain or modify the Service, you hereby authorize us to obtain a report from a consumer credit agency and to exchange information with others in connection with determining your creditworthiness.\n\nWe may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.\n\n(i) Complaint Procedures. If you have any concerns regarding customer service, billing, or service quality, please contact us via the methods set forth in your monthly invoice or in the “Contact Us” section of verizon.com. When you contact us, please explain the nature and history of the problem. We will try to promptly resolve your concern. If we are unable to resolve your concern, we will notify you that we are unable to do so and explain the reason why.\n\n(j) Braille and Large Print Bills.

The Service may be interrupted from time to time for a variety of reasons, and Verizon does not represent or warrant that the Service or the Equipment, or any Other Devices, will be available or perform in a manner that meets your needs.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ANY MANUFACTURER WARRANTY FOR ANY EQUIPMENT OR OTHER DEVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON (BUT ONLY IF SUCH WARRANTY IS INCLUDED WITH SUCH EQUIPMENT OR OTHER DEVICES), VERIZON (AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES), (COLLECTIVELY THE “VERIZON PARTIES”), ITS THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS, DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS FOR THE SERVICE, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, NON- INTERFERENCE, TITLE, COMPATIBILITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, COMPATIBILITY OF SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, INTEGRATION, AND THOSE ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF TRADE, OR ARISING UNDER STATUTE. ALSO, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF WORKMANLIKE EFFORT OR LACK OF NEGLIGENCE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION GIVEN BY VERIZON OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ADVICE PROVIDED.\n\n(c) VERIZON DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT SERVICE CAN BE PROVISIONED TO YOUR LOCATION OR THAT PROVISIONING WILL OCCUR ACCORDING TO A SPECIFIED SCHEDULE, EVEN IF VERIZON HAS ACCEPTED YOUR ORDER FOR SERVICE. THE PROVISIONING OF SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO NETWORK AVAILABILITY AND THE CONDITION OF WIRING INSIDE YOUR LOCATION, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT YOUR LINE IS NOT PROVISIONED FOR ANY REASON, NEITHER YOU NOR VERIZON SHALL HAVE ANY DUTIES OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN YOUR OBLIGATION TO RETURN ANY EQUIPMENT).\n\n(d) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE VERIZON PARTIES OR VERIZON’S THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR INFORMATION OR DAMAGE TO DATA ARISING OUT OF THE USE, PARTIAL USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, OR RELIANCE ON OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CLAIM OR THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE ARISING UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY, EVEN IF VERIZON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CLAIM OR DAMAGES, OR (B) ANY CLAIMS AGAINST YOU BY ANY OTHER PARTY.\n\n(e) THE LIABILITY OF THE VERIZON PARTIES, OR (SUBJECT TO ANY DIFFERENT LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIRD-PARTY END-USER LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENTS) OUR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS, FOR ALL CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED A PRO RATA CREDIT FOR THE MONTHLY FEES (EXCLUDING ALL NONRECURRING CHARGES, REGULATORY FEES, SURCHARGES, FEES AND TAXES) YOU HAVE PAID TO VERIZON FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO WHEN SUCH CLAIM AROSE, WHICH SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CLAIM OR NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO ASSERT ANY LIMITATIONS OR DEFENSES WHICH ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW.\n\n(f) ALL LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS STATED IN THIS SECTION 12 ALSO APPLY TO VERIZON’S THIRD- PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS, AS THIRD- PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n(g) THE REMEDIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER CERTAIN LAWS (SUCH AS CONSUMER LAWS), WHICH DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY, OUR EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n13. INDEMNIFICATION.\n\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Verizon Parties from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees, related to or arising from your use of the Service, the Equipment, and any Other Devices used in connection with the Service (or the use of your Service or any such Equipment or Other Devices by anyone else), (i) in violation of applicable laws, regulations or this Agreement including, without limitation, infringement of copyrights or other proprietary rights; or (ii) in any manner that harms any person or results in the personal injury or death of any person or in damage to or loss of any tangible or intangible (including data) property.\n\n14. NOTICES.\n\nIf either of us intends to seek arbitration under this Agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Verizon of either arbitration or mediation should be sent to NoticeOfDispute@verizon.com or to Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920. A copy of the Notice of Dispute form can also be found at www.verizon.com/terms/disputes. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought, in the manner directed in the applicable arbitration or mediation Section of this Agreement. Other notices required under this Agreement shall be provided by you by contacting us via the methods set forth in your monthly invoice or in the Contact Us section of verizon.com. Our notices to you shall be deemed given:\n\n(a) when sent by e-mail to your last-known e-mail address according to our records; (b) when delivered over the cable system; (c) when deposited in the United States mail addressed to you at your last-known address;\n\n(d) when hand-delivered to your Premises, as applicable or (e) when included in our billing statements to you, regardless of whether billing statements are mailed to you or you have elected a paperless billing option.\n\n15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\n(a) Survival. All obligations of the parties under this Agreement, which, by their nature, would continue beyond the termination of the Agreement, including, without limitation, those relating to Limitation of Liability and Indemnification, shall survive such termination.\n\n(b) Assignment. You agree not to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or your rights and obligations under it, in whole or in part, to any other person. Any attempt to do so shall be void. Furthermore, you agree to notify us of any changes of ownership of, or occupancy in, the Premises immediately upon such transfer of ownership or change in occupancy. We may freely assign all or any part of this Agreement with or without notice to you and you agree to make all subsequent payments as directed.\n\n(c) Applicable Law. Except as otherwise required by law, you and Verizon agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and the substantive laws of the state and local area in which your Premises is located (the “Service Jurisdiction”), without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, will be applied to govern, construe and enforce all of the rights and duties of the parties arising from or related in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement. UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, YOU AND VERIZON CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT LOCATED IN THE SERVICE JURISDICTION FOR ANY SUITS OR CAUSES OF ACTION CONNECTED IN ANY WAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT. Except as otherwise required by law, including the Service Jurisdiction laws relating to consumer transactions, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Service must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is forever waived.\n\n(d) Waiver. Verizon’s failure at any time to insist upon strict compliance with any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such terms in the future. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the unenforceable portion shall be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties.\n\n(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including any policies or materials that are incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Verizon with respect to the subject matter hereto and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements whether written or oral. No changes by you to this Agreement shall be effective unless agreed to in writing, signed by an authorized person at Verizon.\n\n16. VOLUNTARY MEDIATION.\n\nVerizon offers customers the option of participating in a free internal mediation program. This program is entirely voluntary and does not affect either party's rights in any other aspect of the dispute resolution procedures outlined in Section 17. In our voluntary mediation program, we will assign an employee who is not directly involved in the dispute to help both sides reach an agreement. That person has all the rights and protections of a mediator and the process has all of the protections associated with mediation. For example, nothing said in the mediation can be used later in an arbitration or lawsuit. If you would like to know more, or you would like to start the mediation process, please contact us at NoticeOfDispute@verizon.com or through Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920, for a Notice of Customer Dispute Form. A copy of the Notice of Dispute form can also be found at www.verizon.com/terms/disputes. Fill out and send the Notice of Dispute Form to us according to the directions on the form.\n\n17. ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS.\n\nWe hope to make you a happy customer, but if there's an issue that needs to be resolved, this Section outlines what's expected of both of us. YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:\n\n(a) The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Agreement. Except for small claims court cases that qualify, any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of this agreement or from any equipment, products and services you receive from us (or from any advertising for any such products or services) will be resolved by one or more neutral arbitrators before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). You can also bring any issues you may have to the Better Business Bureau (\"BBB\"), attention of federal, state, or local government agencies, and if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\n\n(b) UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR SERVICE JURISDICTION. For claims over $10,000, the AAA's arbitration rules will apply; in such cases, the loser can ask for a panel of three new arbitrators to review the award. For claims of $10,000 or less, the party bringing the claim can choose either the AAA's rules or, alternatively, can bring an individual action in small claims court. You can get procedures, rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org) or from us. For claims of $10,000 or less, you can choose whether you would like the arbitration carried out based only on documents submitted to the arbitrator, or by a hearing in–person or by phone.\n\n(c) THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS PERMISSIBLE. THE ARBITRATOR ALSO SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO PRESIDE OVER CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, OR TO AWARD ANY FORM OF CLASSWIDE OR COLLECTIVE REMEDY. INSTEAD, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE POWER TO AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NO RULE WILL APPLY IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION IN THE AAA RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE BOUND TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY RELIEF THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SUCH LAWS.\n\n(d) IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. Notice to Verizon should be sent to NoticeOfDispute@verizon.com or to Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration. Verizon will pay any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, Verizon will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If that arbitration proceeds, we'll also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later, as well as for any appeal to a panel of three new arbitrators (if the arbitration award is appealable under this agreement).\n\n(e) We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer any time before the arbitration evidentiary hearing begins (or, if there is no evidentiary hearing, before the parties complete submission of their evidence to the arbitrator). The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5000, or if we do not ma k e you an offer and the arbitrator awards you any amount of money but less than $5000, then we agree to pay you $5000 instead of the amount awarded. In that case we also agree to pay any reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, regardless of whether the law requires it for your case. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5000, then we will pay you the amount awarded.\n\n(f) An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.\n\n(g) IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION 17(c) CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.\n\n(h) IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND VERIZON AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\n\nExhibit A |\n|\n|\nLocation | VERIZON AFFILIATE PROVIDING VIDEO SERVICE | VERIZON INTERNET SERVICE AFFILIATE PROVIDING EQUIPMENT |\nDelaware | Verizon Delaware LLC | Verizon OnlineLLC |\nMaryland | Verizon Maryland Inc. | Verizon Online -Maryland LLC |\nMassachusetts | Verizon New England Inc. | Verizon Online LLC |\nNew Jersey | Verizon New Jersey Inc. | Verizon Online LLC |\nNew York | Verizon New York Inc. | Verizon Online LLC |\nPennsylvania | Verizon Pennsylvania LLC | Verizon Online Pennsylvania Partnership |\nRhode Island | Verizon New England Inc. | Verizon Online LLC |\nVirginia (with exception) | Verizon Virginia Inc. | Verizon Online LLC |\nDumfries, Chesapeake, | Verizon South Inc. | Verizon Online LLC |\n\n\nEXHIBIT B\n\nON DEMAND SERVICES\n\nVerizon On Demand Services provide a multi-screen viewing function for certain Fios TV content, and is included as part of your Fios TV Services.\n\nYour use of On Demand Services is conditional upon your continued adherence to the Verizon Online Terms of Service and the Fios TV Terms of Service, located at https://www.verizon.com/terms and of Verizon’s Acceptable Use Policy, which is included in Exhibit B. In the event of any conflict between these Verizon Fios TV Terms of Service and the Verizon Online Terms of Service, the Verizon Fios TV Terms of Service will control solely to the extent of such conflict.\n\n1. Definitions.\n\n\"Content\" shall mean video, audio, image or other files or data in digital or electronic form of any type provided through the Service.\n\n\"On Demand Library Content\" means the collection of rented or unlimited/purchased On Demand Content, as defined below.\n\n2. User Account. You must establish and/or maintain a \"My Verizon\" account at http://verizon.com/myverizon and enable such My Verizon account to license On Demand Content (on a rental or unlimited basis). Your \"My Verizon\" account will then become an \"On Demand Enabled Account.\"\n\n3. Authorized Devices. In order to access the On Demand Library Content, you will need a compatible viewing device, such as a PC or a portable/handset device, that (i) meets the minimum technical requirements that Verizon may establish from time to time, (ii) supports the digital rights management system, if any, required for access to the On Demand Library Content, and (iii) has been registered with your On Demand Enabled Account (each, a \"On Demand Authorized Device\"). You can register up to five (5) On Demand Authorized Devices per On Demand Enabled Account, and if you subscribe to Fios TV, all of your set-top boxes within a single household will count as one of your allotted On Demand Authorized Devices. In order to register and de-register portable On Demand Authorized Devices, you need to register the device through a Verizon-provided application. You are only permitted to de-register two (2) On Demand Authorized Devices per On Demand Account per calendar year without connecting through your PC and you are only permitted to de-register and re- register the same On Demand Authorized Device two (2) times within a calendar year.\n\n4. On Demand Service Description & Conditions of Use\n\n4.1 On Demand Service allows you to access and view On Demand Content in a variety of ways:\n\na. by streaming On Demand Content to your TV through a Verizon-supplied Fios TV set-top box;\n\nb. by downloading On Demand View Content to an authorized wireless handset or portable device, or other customer equipment supporting media playback, using Verizon-provided applications. Verizon may enable you to stream On Demand Content to your device.\n\n4.2. On Demand Service Requirements. Internet access is required to use the Services. You are solely responsible for compliance with any minimum system requirements, and for obtaining, installing, configuring, and maintaining suitable equipment and software, including any necessary system or software upgrades, patches or other fixes, which are or may become necessary to access the Services. Certain downloaded content may be viewed offline. Not all On Demand Content is available for download. Fast-forward, rewind, 3-Day Rewind for viewing programming that has aired in the previous three days, and other viewing capabilities may vary. The availability of standard definition, high definition, and ultra-high definition video programming may also vary.\n\nYou acknowledge that delivery of Content is dependent on variables not under Verizon’s control, including, but not limited to, the speed and availability of your broadband or network connection. You may experience delays or technical difficulties caused by or related to such variables, as well as the technical limitations of the On Demand Authorized Device on which you view the On Demand Library Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you will not receive a refund or credit for any Content that you are not able to view or have difficulty viewing due to such variables. You bear all responsibility for ensuring that you have the viewing capabilities to view Content in the appropriate format or at all.\n\n4.3. The On Demand Service is intended solely for your non- transferable, non-commercial, private and personal use, and any other use or attempted use for commercial or other purposes is strictly prohibited. You understand and agree that advertisements, as well as certain communications from Verizon such as service announcements and administrative messages, are part of the Services and are necessary for Verizon to provide the Services. Your use of third-party platforms, such as Ultraviolet and Disney Movies Anywhere, may require your periodic consent for us to share content with the platform providers.\n\n4.4. Digital Licenses for On Demand Content. Regardless of the use of the word \"purchase,\" and except as set forth herein, all On Demand Content is offered for license, not purchase or sale, and is subject to this Agreement and any other license terms and conditions applicable to the On Demand Content, including limitations imposed by the use of any digital rights management technology. On Demand Content can be licensed in two ways:\n\n4.4.1. Purchased On Demand Content: When you purchase On Demand Content, the payment of a purchase fee will entitle you to access the purchased On Demand Content for viewing on Authorized Devices an unlimited number of times over an indefinite period of time. Purchased On Demand Content will continue to be accessible if you are no longer a Fios TV customer, but your use of such On Demand Services will be subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n\n4.4.2. Rented On Demand Content: When you rent On Demand Content, the payment of a rental fee will entitle you to access the rented On Demand Content for viewing on one or more Authorized Devices an unlimited number of times over a fixed period of time, typically 24 hours from the purchase or initial playback of the Rented On Demand Content. Upon the payment of the rental fee, you may be given the option to \"Watch On This Screen\" or \"Watch on Any Screen\".\n\n4.4.2.1. If you select \"Watch On This Screen\", you can watch the Rented On Demand Content only on the specific On Demand Authorized Device on which the payment of the rental fee was made. The rented title will be downloaded to such On Demand Authorized Device, and it will be viewable as many times as you like for a viewing period of 24 (or in some cases up to 48) hours from the time you first initiate playback of the rented title. You must not delete the digital file from local storage prior to initiating playback, and you must initiate playback within 30 days of your rental purchase.\n\n4.4.2.2. If you select \"Watch On Any Screen\", you will have 24 (or in some cases up to 48) hours from the time of the payment of your rental fee to watch (and if necessary, download) the title as may times as you like on any of your On Demand Authorized Devices. However, only one of your On Demand Authorized Devices may play back the Rental Content at any one time.\n\n4.4.3. Upon the payment of either a purchase or rental fee, Verizon grants you a limited, non- exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use the On Demand Content solely for your personal, non-commercial/non-public, entertainment use.\n\n4.5. Purchased On Demand Content Availability. Once you purchase or rent On Demand Content, you bear the responsibility for completing download and/or use and for all risk of loss of the purchased and downloaded On Demand Content. Verizon encourages you to download or access your Purchased On Demand Content immediately after purchase.\n\n4.5.1. Purchased On Demand Content may become unavailable for streaming (including streaming to your TV via a Verizon Fios TV set-top box) or re- download due to Content provider licensing and other restrictions, and Verizon will not be liable to you if Purchased On Demand Content becomes unavailable for further download, streaming and/or use.\n\n4.5.2. Re-delivery of purchased On Demand Content. Verizon can only re-deliver to you the digital files containing Purchased On Demand Content a maximum of two (2) times during any calendar year.\n\n4.5.3. Restrictions on Streamed Viewing. Verizon may limit the number of concurrent streams (including any streams delivered to the TV via a Fios TV set-top box) that are available from the same account at any one time. The maximum number of concurrent streams, the number of additional streams that may be purchased, and the concurrent availability of the same On Demand titles may vary. Streaming and downloading are available only in the U.S. and U.S. territories.\n\n4.6. Reservation of Rights. All Content provided by Verizon or its third party licensors on any website or other resource provided by Verizon at which On Demand Content may be purchased, including, without limitation, images, animations, previews, video programming, information services, audio, music, and text, irrespective of the manner or format in which such Content is delivered, is the property of Verizon or its licensors. You understand and acknowledge that your rights with respect to On Demand Content are limited by copyright law. All rights regarding use of On Demand Content not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Verizon and/or its licensors.\n\n4.7. General Restrictions. The Services are intended for use within the United States. You agree to follow all rules and policies applicable to the Services, including required or automated updates, modifications and/or reinstallations of Access Software or other software and obtaining available patches to address security, interoperability and/or performance issues. You also agree: (i) to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations when using the Services and accessing or viewing On Demand Library Content; and (ii) not to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise tamper with or modify any of the security features, usage restrictions or other Service components for any reason (or help anyone else to do so).\n\n5. Data Charges. You acknowledge and agree that you may also incur data charges or fees from a wireless or internet service provider (which may be Verizon or a third party) for accessing online services or purchasing products and services through interactive options available through the Service. You are solely responsible for all charges or fees payable to Verizon or third parties, including all applicable taxes. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.\n\nEXHIBIT C\n\nACCEPTABLE USE POLICY\n\n1. General Policy: Verizon reserves the sole discretion to deny or restrict your Service, or immediately to suspend or terminate your Service, if the use of your Service by you or anyone using it, in our sole discretion, violates the Agreement or other Verizon policies, is objectionable or unlawful, interferes with the functioning or use of the Internet or the Verizon network by Verizon or other users, or violates the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\").\n\n2.

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable laws, it is the policy of Verizon to suspend or terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the Service provided to any subscriber or account holder who is deemed to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers of copyrights. In addition, Verizon expressly reserves the right to suspend, terminate or take other interim action regarding the Service of any Subscriber or account holder if Verizon, in its sole judgment, believes that circumstances relating to an infringement of third party intellectual property rights warrant such action. These policies are in addition to and do not affect or modify any other rights Verizon may have under law or contract. If you believe that copyrighted material has been used in violation of this policy or otherwise been made available on the Service in a manner that is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law, please follow the instructions for contacting Verizon's designated Copyright Agent as set forth in Verizon's Copyright Policy located at http://www.verizon.com/copy.html.\n\n4.

      "content": "# Fire Island NY Voice Link Terms of Service\n\nWelcome to Verizon Voice Link Service.\n\nPlease read this agreement carefully before filing it in a safe place for future reference.\n\nIn this Agreement (“Agreement”), “you” and “your” mean the customer of Verizon Voice Link Service (“Service(s)”) defined below, and “Verizon,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean Verizon New York Inc., the company that is providing you with Service. You acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or older, and you agree that you have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and affirm that the information you supply to us is correct and complete. Providing false or incorrect information may result in Service provisioning delays or the inability of a 911-dialed call to be correctly routed to emergency response center personnel.\n\nThis Agreement incorporates the terms of your Calling Plan, which is the specific Plan that you chose to purchase from among the Calling Plans available for the Service. Your Calling Plan includes your monthly service allowances, features and pricing. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and your Calling Plan, the terms in your Calling Plan will govern. The terms of each of the Calling Plans available for the Service, including your Calling Plan, are available online at www.verizon.com/tariffs/westfireisland.\n\nCertain sections of this Agreement refer to the “Tariff,” for example by stating that a particular term of the Agreement is “as set forth in” or “in accordance with” the Tariff. “Tariff” means the relevant provisions of Verizon Tariff PSC No. 1, Section 1, as amended from time to time. The Tariff is available online at http://www22.verizon.com/tariffs/. Such references are intended only to incorporate the text of the applicable provision(s) of the Tariff as if they had been set forth verbatim in this document, and thus to make the substance of those provisions binding and enforceable under applicable contract law as terms of this Agreement. Such incorporation is not intended in any way to make this Agreement part of the Tariff.\n\nWhere the Service is the only Verizon voice service available to you, if required by applicable law or regulation, (a) Verizon will adhere to any requirements relating to customer protection, customer complaints, service quality, safety and reliability that apply to tariffed local exchange service; and (b) in the event of a conflict between any term herein and such requirements, such requirements shall govern except to the extent Verizon is permitted by the Public Service Commission or other court or agency with jurisdiction to modify such requirements as they apply to the Service.\n\nThis Agreement becomes binding when you accept this Agreement. You accept this Agreement and Verizon’s terms and charges when you subscribe to, use or pay for the Services or tell us orally or through written or electronic means that you accept the Agreement.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE AND CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY TO TERMINATE IT.

If the Device is installed by a Verizon technician, the installation process will confirm that jacks utilized for telephone service within the home at the time of installation are functional with the Service.\n\nd) The Device may not be compatible with certain monitored home security systems. Please check with your home security system provider to confirm the compatibility requirements of your home security system.\n\ne) The Device must be connected to cordless or corded telephone hardware, as described in the Welcome Package.

After the battery is exhausted, the Service (including 911 dialing) will not function until power is restored. In addition, if the landline phone to which the Device is connected requires external electrical power to operate, the Service (including 911dialing) will not be available during a power outage even if the back-up battery is functional. A power failure or disruption may require you to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to using the Service.\n\nc) International Calling, Directory Listings and Directory Assistance.

You agree to promptly notify Verizon whenever your personal or billing information changes (including, for example, your name, address, Email address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date).

You acknowledge and agree that at all times ownership of the Device shall remain with us and that this Agreement allows you to use the Device only in connection with your receipt and use of the Service. We will repair and maintain the Device owned by us at our expense, unless such repair or maintenance is made necessary due to misuse, abuse or intentional damage to the Device, in which case you will be financially responsible for the repair or replacement of the damaged Device. You also agree that the Device will not be serviced by anyone other than our employees or our designated agents or representatives. Except as otherwise instructed by Verizon, upon termination of the Service you are responsible for returning the Device to us in an undamaged condition. Failure to return the Device within 30 days as instructed by Verizon, or returning the Device in a damaged condition (subject only to reasonable wear and tear), may result in our charging you an unreturned equipment fee. If instructed by Verizon to leave the Device in place, then you must not remove the Device and you will not be charged an unreturned equipment fee as long as the Device is left in place in reasonable condition (subject only to reasonable wear and tear).\n\n3) REVISIONS TO TERMS AND PRICING\n\nFrom time to time, we may revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the prices for the Service. Such revisions will be subject to the provisions of Section 1(C)(3) of the Tariff. Increases to the prices or material revisions to the Agreement shall be effective no sooner than 30 days after we provide notice to you in accordance with Section 5 below. If you do not agree to Verizon’s revision(s), you must terminate your Service immediately in accordance with this Agreement. By continuing to use the Service after revisions are in effect, you accept and agree to all revisions.\n\n4) PRICING AND PAYMENT\n\na) Prices and Fees. You agree to pay us for the Service at the prices and charges that are billed to you. Billing for the Service will begin automatically upon activation of the Service. Monthly recurring charges will be billed one month in advance. The charges for any particular call will depend on a number of factors which include, for example, your Calling Plan, call duration, and type of call (e.g., domestic or international). International calls to certain types of phone numbers (e.g., mobile numbers) may be subject to additional charges. If you activate certain features, such as three-way calling or call forwarding, additional per minute or international charges may be incurred. You will be charged for calls forwarded to international numbers as though the forwarded calls originated from your Voice Link Service. All charges due are payable in immediately available U.S. dollars.\n\nb) Call rounding/detail. For Calling Plans with per minute measured usage, including international dialing, all calls are rounded up to the next highest minute and billed accordingly.

You agree that a Service outage due to suspension of your account as a result of billing issues will prevent ALL Service, including any 911 dialing and associated emergency response services.\n\nc) Potential Limitations. You agree that any 911 calls made using the Service may be subject to network congestion and/or reduced routing or processing speed. If you have Call Forwarding, or other features programmed and in use at the time you dial a 911 call and your call is interrupted, the emergency dispatcher may not be able to call you back at the phone from which you dialed the call.\n\nd) Additional Service Limitations that Apply in the Event that Verizon Cannot Route Your 911 Call Directly to the Appropriate Emergency Service Provider. If, for any reason, Verizon cannot directly route your 911 call to the appropriate emergency service provider, your 911 call may be routed to a Verizon operator. You agree that the operator and/or emergency response center personnel receiving your call may not be able to identify your phone number or the physical address from which you are calling. You will need to state the nature of your emergency promptly and clearly, including your telephone number and location. You agree that the individual answering the call may not be able to call you back or determine your location if the call is unable to be completed, is dropped or disconnected, or if you are unable to provide your phone number and physical location and/or if the Service is not operational for any reason. After you identify your location, the Verizon operator will determine the appropriate emergency response center for your location and route you to the general telephone number for that center.\n\ne) If the Device is moved or relocated from your Service location it may not function properly. Any movement of the Device from your Service location will impair your ability to receive emergency services when dialing 911, including the transmission of an incorrect address to emergency personnel.\n\n8) SOFTWARE LICENSES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES\n\na) We may provide you, for a fee or at no charge, software for use in connection with the Service which is owned by us or our third-party licensors, providers and suppliers (“Software”).

      "content": "# How to outsmart screen time for a better bedtime routine\n\n## A cognitive specialist explains a hack for your evening to bedtime routines to make the transition from screen time to bedtime as smooth as a lullaby.\n\n\nHow did you sleep last night?\n\nResearch shows that sleep is just as important for children as a healthy diet and physical activity for a developing brain. Yet many children today are dealing with sleep deprivation.\n\nThat’s why, every night, it’s the same routine in our house. At 6:30 PM we shut down screen time and the laptops, tablets and electronic devices go off and into their designated charging station. Then it’s family time—a carefully created serotonin-inducing routine (with a little smart tech built in) that’s designed to help us all get a good night’s sleep. And it works. Even with two brilliant, neurodivergent children whose best friends are electronics.\n\nWhy does it work? Because this evening routine considers how cortisol, dopamine and serotonin work together so that our family time is more rewarding than the screen time the kids would be getting before bed.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s neurotransmitters and hormones. Here’s how you can create a better evening routine for your family.\n\n## Bedtime routines: But first, sleep\n\nWhen you spend an extended period of time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain begins processing and retaining the information that occurred earlier during the day. That’s an important time for children to process everything they learned that day—important developmental and cognitive skills and academic knowledge. Not getting enough REM sleep can impact information retention.\n\nHow much sleep a kid needs is based on age and developmental stage. Since sleep boosts brain development, babies need the most sleep. The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine recommends the following for optimal health:\n\nInfants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps).\n\nChildren 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis.\n\nChildren 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis.\n\nChildren 6 to 12 years of age should sleep nine to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis.\n\nTeenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep eight to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis.\n\n\nModern life, busy schedules and screen time throughout the day can all impact the body’s natural circadian rhythms. And like any rhythm, if the drummer’s off the beat, it can throw off the whole show.\n\nThe circadian rhythm is the natural internal process that regulates the sleep and awake states. These 24-hour cycles manage physical, behavioral and mental changes. Circadian rhythms can influence hormone release, body temperature and digestion, which are essential functions in our body.\n\nHere are some of the key hormones and neurotransmitters affected by the circadian rhythm and how they affect your child.\n\n## Good morning, cortisol\n\nCortisol is responsible for a lot that goes on in your body: It controls your stress response, regulates metabolism and is anti-inflammatory. Levels are highest in the morning. When cortisol levels are out of balance, a child can feel anxious and have attention and focus issues.\n\n## The reward center: dopamine\n\nDopamine helps facilitate communication among the regions of the brain called the “reward center.” It’s also essential for movement and memory. Spending time on screens can boost dopamine levels—for a good reason. Instant gratification from racking up points in a game, or getting that instant message from a friend, feels good. It’s a big reason why transitioning off screens can leave kids feeling cranky or sluggish. That’s also why some kids beg for another five or 10 minutes of screen time.\n\n## Making memories with serotonin\n\nSerotonin is known as the “happy chemical.” This neurotransmitter regulates mood, and when it’s in balance, you can feel happier, calmer and more focused. It’s also the chemical responsible for waking up and falling asleep. When you think back to a happy childhood memory, serotonin kicks in to help you retrieve that memory. Serotonin-inducing activities, such as spending time with a caring parent, help your brain remember: “This is something I look forward to, and I want to do it again.”\n\n## Melatonin to sleep\n\nWhen the lights go off, melatonin kicks in to help you fall asleep. As the sun or light enters the room, your body starts to make less melatonin, so you can wake up naturally. Screens can interrupt this rhythm and fool your brain into not producing enough melatonin, causing you to stay alert longer than anticipated.\n\n## From screen time to bedtime\n\nTeenagers have other hormones interfering with their daily rhythms, but in focusing on the hormones above, this routine works best with most kids under the age of 13.\n\n- 6:30 PM — Turn off all electronic devices and put them into their designated spaces.\n\n- 6:30 to 7 PM — Engage in an activity you’ve planned that kids can look forward to after getting off screens, such as going outside or having a dance party. In our house, we use this time to transition from the work and school day to family time. We’re all working together to get dinner ready, such as setting the table or doing other house chores\n\n- 7 PM — Have family dinner together. At the dinner table, everyone takes a turn talking about their day. That’s when serotonin can kick in as we’re talking together, bonding, building memories, and it becomes something that the kids look forward to each night.\n\n- 7:15 PM — Get ready for bed. The kids go upstairs, brush teeth and come downstairs with a book for us read together. Kids don’t always like to do things such as brushing their teeth. We intentionally stack this type of chore with a reward, or something that they look forward to. So they start to associate something they need to do with something they want to do, which is read together.\n\n- 7:30 PM — Have kids choose their own unwinding activities in their rooms that don’t involve screens, such as reading on their own, or listening to audiobooks or music on smart speakers. And if it’s been an active or stressful day, incorporate some light stretching, using some stretching apps as a guide.\n- 8 PM —Listen to calming sounds on smart speakers before bed.\n- 8:30–9 PM — Fall asleep to favorite sounds as the lights go down and melatonin kicks in.\n\nIt may sound like common sense, but the goal is to ensure that time with you is just as rewarding as screen time. So it’s about creating the kind of bedtime routine that sets up both you and them to make the best of that time together.\n\nSleep well.\n\nTurn off their WiFi and data from one app on your phone—Smart Family.",

Two experts share their tips and ideas to create something special.\n\n\nLooking for a great gift for Dad this Father’s Day? Between the built-in camera and the photos saved to your device, there’s a good chance that your smartphone already has everything you need. To help you get started, we asked two experts to share some ideas for family photo projects. Here are their suggestions for making a keepsake he’s sure to treasure.\n\n## 1. Digitize his favorite photos.\n\nIf you currently have a box (or more than one) of family photos in storage, make digital copies using a photo scanning app on your smartphone. “I now use scanning apps on my phone whenever I’m doing research at the library,” says Denise Levenick, author of the Family Curator blog. “Scanning apps also make it much easier to share digital versions of photos with people in my family.”\n\n**For your Father’s Day gift idea: **Scan a few photos in a small batch for Father’s Day and save them to Verizon Cloud. As part of the gift, set aside time to scan more together throughout the year. According to Esther Schindler, a tech writer who spent a year converting her father’s photo slides into a family archive, scanning photos in small, manageable batches has notable advantages over digitizing them all at once. “It turned scanning into a contemplative process and a process of discovery,” she says. “Going through a box of slides from a single camping trip, I could think about all my memories of that trip … it can really bring everything back for you.”\n\n## 2. Make a digital photo album around a single theme.\n\nAs you sort through family photos, keep an eye out for recurring people, places, or events that could inspire a themed family photo series. For Levenick, tracing the theme of cars through her family’s photo collection not only resulted in some memorable keepsakes, but also helped uncover an important intergenerational connection. “My grandfather learned to be a mechanic in the early days of cars. Fast-forward to my dad, who’s a total car fan and became a hot-rodder when he retired. [Their shared love of cars] was a huge connection that my dad hadn’t put together … I think once he realized that, he appreciated his dad in a way he hadn’t before,” she says.\n\n**For your Father’s Day gift idea: **Create a photo series that tracks a single subject or theme, such as family cars, pets, vacations or traditions. Then, compile them into a photo book with Verizon Cloud.\n\n## 3. Create modern versions of old family candid photos.\n\nRecreating a favorite family photo, especially if it’s a candid shot, can be a fun way to revisit family memories while creating new ones. And here’s a bonus gift idea: The camera on the new Samsung Galaxy S24+ has some AI features built in that make it easy to edit any shot, and you could use the free tablet that comes with it as a dedicated digital family photo album (shop Father’s Day deals here).\n\n**For your Father’s Day gift idea:** For an activity that gets the whole family involved, try recreating an especially memorable candid shot from your photo collection. Get creative with costumes and props and do your best to replicate the original poses and facial expressions. Then, on Father’s Day, display your recreation side by side with the original using the Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen).\n\n## 4. Discover (and share) family history.\n\nFor Levenick, curating photos has been a crucial way of preserving her family’s history, starting with a photobook her grandfather had made documenting his experiences in World War I. “A few years ago, there was a big WWI anniversary, so I pulled out that book and took apart the string binding to scan each photo page by page,” she says. “I then used those digital images to make a new photo book I could share.”\n\n**For your Father’s Day gift idea:** Invite Dad to a digital platform where he can view, share, and connect with relatives over family photos. Schindler says that in addition to helping her crowdsource missing information (such as when or where a particular photo was taken), posting photos to private social media groups and genealogy sites has made it possible for her to connect with members of her extended family. “I have a cousin who will send me a note any time I post a photo of her father, and she’ll tell me a story about the picture,” she says. “[Sharing photos digitally] really connects people across generations.”\n\n## 5. Turn photos into a gift he can use.\n\nA digital photo frame is just one way to display the results of your photo project. Once you’ve scanned and saved photos to your phone, it’s easy to screen-print them onto a variety of creative gifts, from pillow covers and coffee mugs to a custom grill apron.\n\n**For your Father’s Day gift idea: **Preserving handwritten items by scanning and saving them as photos, and then printing them on a gift, can also be a great way to feel close to family members, particularly those who have passed away.\n\nPlanning to add new photos to the family archive this Father’s Day? Schindler has a word of advice:\n\n“It’s perfectly okay to ask a stranger to take a picture, especially if that means you can be part of it,” she says. “In other words, let the photo capture the moment, but don’t let it replace it.”\n\nKeep them safe in the digital world, so you can focus on them in the real world.

      "content": "# Why 5G can be the difference-maker in education\n\n## Glimpse the potential impact of a next-generation network on teaching—inside and outside the classroom.\n\n\nEducation has always been considered one of the most promising areas for 5G-powered innovation. Buoyed by the massive bandwidth and dramatically reduced latency of a next-generation wireless network, educators and software developers alike could refine digital teaching tools to an uncommon degree, while also developing new ones that explode the two-dimensional lesson plan.\n\nImagine a classroom where students use virtual or augmented reality to walk amid an ancient ruin, or at-home learning where students seamlessly collaborate on group projects. “Whether kids have returned to the classroom or are remote learning, we need to think of new ways technology can help them engage with educational content,” says Sanyogita Shamsunder, Vice President of Technology Development and 5G Labs at Verizon.\n\nTo that end, here is just a glimpse into the potential directions that 5G-powered education might take.\n\n## Immersive AR and VR in the classroom\n\nNext-generation network power could alter how teachers and students interact with each other and their materials. With a high bandwidth, low latency network like Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband, heavy processing and rendering could potentially move off of a VR headset and into the cloud, allowing wearers longer battery life, lighter hardware and—eventually—lower cost, which could help increase accessibility of these devices.\n\nThose same advantages are also poised to help educational content developers, who—because they wouldn’t be as constrained by the limitations of the hardware—could potentially realize their creative visions in ways they haven’t been able to before.\n\nImagine teachers guiding students through the take-off sequence of a space shuttle or flying through the human circulatory system, allowing children to see the lesson unfold before their eyes—and literally losing themselves in learning.\n\n## Education technology for good\n\nBut the potential impact of 5G on education isn’t limited to instruction. It could help change how people work together, too. Group projects are proven to improve children’s ability to cooperate and build empathy, and 5G Ultra Wideband could make collaboration—both in and out of the classroom—a powerful tool in teachers’ arsenals.\n\nThe low latency achieved by 5G Ultra Wideband in particular could help power scenarios where remote collaboration between students could eventually feel as natural as talking between desks. Think about a group art project. Where a 5G Ultra Wideband uplink exists in a school, kids from different classrooms could meet in a virtual art studio and collaborate on a mural in near-real time.\n\nWith near-real-time response, 5G in education offers the potential for new paths of instruction and classroom engagement, enabling students to not only learn how to use advanced technologies, but also how to develop and create with them. Initiatives like the Verizon 5G EdTech Challenge have surfaced tantalizing innovations, proving that the only limits placed on 5G-powered educational content developers come from their imagination.\n\nThe promise of 5G also contains the promise of a leveled playing field. A lack of connectivity can hamper learning efforts. Initiatives like Verizon Innovative Learning help foster digital inclusion in under-resourced communities through a transformative, STEM-based education program. In 2019, Verizon launched its first 5G-enabled Verizon Innovative Learning classroom, where students utilize emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality. This technology has brought textbooks to life by giving entire classrooms access to immersive learning programs, where they can visit the inside of an atom, explore the remnants of a dying star or meet underrepresented icons in history.\n\n## Learning on the go\n\nIn an increasingly mobile-first society, the devices in people’s pockets, in their ears and on their wrists answer questions and help them learn. As 5G reaches into more corners of daily life, it has the capacity to make on-the-go education easier, too.\n\nA field trip to the museum could transform from students yapping in a quiet museum to enthralled pupils captivated by ambient, mixed-reality images that enhance the learning experience. Imagine a student pointing their tablet at a QR code at the base of an Ice Age diorama, and having an AR 3D skeleton of a wooly mammoth emerge on their screen, complete with interactive elements.\n\nSound like the future? Actually, it's already coming into view.\n\nThe Smithsonian Open Access program brings artifacts to life. \"Activating Smithsonian Open Access is a great step forward toward immersive, interactive, and remote experiences made with the creative community,\" says Shamsunder. “Verizon’s new AR museum sets the stage for even more amazing enhancements when paired with the massive bandwidth and low latency of Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network.\"\n\nWith 5G, learning is poised to come alive in the most remarkable ways.",

What should you do next?\n\n## Your reaction matters when it comes to parental control notifications. A mother-son duo shares research-backed advice on how to talk with your kids when things seem to go awry.\n\n\nIf you use parental controls, it can be alarming to get a notification that your child encountered inappropriate content. But moments like these are opportunities to build trust.\n\nResearch from the American Psychological Association (APA) says that when parents set clear expectations, talk openly about online experiences and help kids process what they encounter, it can create safer habits. These conversations can also help kids feel comfortable asking questions and making smarter choices about what they select online.\n\nBut there’s research, and then there’s real life. To get an idea of what it’s actually like when a parent and child face the inappropriate-content situation together, we spoke with digital parenting coach Elizabeth Milovidov and her son Maximilian, an 18-year-old youth advocate for online safety.\n\nHere’s what they say parents can do after receiving a parental control alert.\n\n## Step 1: Don’t put off the conversation.\n\nDiscovering that your child has encountered inappropriate content can trigger panic, but Elizabeth stresses the importance of staying calm. “Whatever the content is, whether it’s violent, sexual or something else, the first step is for parents to respond to that parental control notification calmly and proactively,” she says.\n\nRushing and reacting in an extreme way, like shutting down all devices, can make kids hesitant to come forward in the future. Once you’re calm, start the conversation—but do it sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Earlier is better because [the content] will still be fresh in their mind,\" says Maximilian.\n\n## Step 2: Ask questions to get more context.\n\nGetting a parental control notification about inappropriate content doesn’t always mean your child intentionally searched for that content. They may have accidentally selected a pop-up, followed a misleading link or encountered the content through an algorithm.\n\nMaximilian emphasizes the need to understand what happened before making assumptions. “You want to make sure they feel heard and that you get the full picture before judging or punishing,” he says.\n\nIf your child sought the content on purpose, it could be out of curiosity, peer pressure or interest in current events. If it’s the first time they’ve triggered a parental control alert, use it as a chance for discussion rather than doling out immediate consequences. If they repeatedly trigger an alert, especially across different platforms, it may signal a pattern that requires more guidance or content restrictions.\n\nElizabeth recommends asking these open-ended questions:\n\n- What did you encounter?\n- How did you find it?\n- How did it make you feel?\n\n“This helps you understand whether they stumbled upon the content accidentally or intentionally, which are two very different conversations,” she says.\n\n## Step 3: Offer reassurance and education.\n\nChildren often feel upset after encountering inappropriate or violent content. “Sometimes kids feel scared, guilty or confused about what they’ve seen,” says Elizabeth.\n\nSigns of distress may include avoiding eye contact, hesitation in answering questions, or appearing anxious or withdrawn. “Offer reassurance by saying, ‘Let’s figure this out together.’”\n\nThis is also an opportunity to reinforce family values—without judgment or shame. “Make sure they understand your expectations and what is and isn’t appropriate,” Elizabeth says, “whether it’s online behavior, media consumption or real-world interactions.”\n\n## Step 4: Decide on next steps.\n\n“If they accessed content by clicking on an ad, this is a chance to teach them about the risks of pop-ups and how to avoid them,” says Elizabeth.\n\nThe goal is to empower kids to navigate the internet safely. “You want to guide them to make better choices and feel confident about staying safe online.”\n\nOnce you understand what triggered the parental control alert and have had the conversation, you can also adjust parental control settings if needed and work on building additional digital literacy skills. On the Verizon Family app, consider updating the following (and make sure the companion app is paired to your phone):\n\n- Content filters to block specific categories of information\n- Screen-time limits, such as no Wi-Fi or data access after 9 PM\n- Safe Search and ad blockers, which you can turn on to help prevent errant selections\n\n## Step 5: Follow up again later.\n\nFind natural moments to check in—like at dinner, when screens are already off. Research from a study of 1,000 parents found that regular family meals improve communication and strengthen relationships with teens. This can make dinnertime an ideal time to discuss digital safety. “Mealtimes can be good opportunities because kids are already disconnected from their devices,” says Maximilian.\n\nElizabeth also points out that regular conversations reinforce good habits. She suggests checking in over the next few weeks to answer any questions.\n\nWith these tips, parents can continue to be proactive digital guides instead of simply reacting to alerts. As Elizabeth points out, “Every conversation about tech can be a teaching moment.”\n\nGet insights about your child’s digital life with Verizon Family.\n\nScreenshot this for later\n\n## Using parental control alerts to build trust\n\n- Take a breath before reacting. Don’t panic or shut down devices. Start a calm conversation as soon as possible.\n- Ask questions to understand. Was it an accident? Peer pressure? An algorithm? Get the full picture first.\n- Offer reassurance, not shame. Help kids process what they experienced and reinforce family values without judgment.\n- Adjust parental control settings. Adjust filters, turn on Safe Search and use alerts to start ongoing conversations.\n- Follow up. Check in regularly to talk about digital safety.\n\nverizon.com/parenting\n\nAudrey Smith is a multimedia journalist, public media producer and former high school English teacher whose writing focuses on tech, AI and digital literacy for kids.\n\n\n*The author has been compensated by Verizon for this article.*\n\n## Related Articles\n\nSportsmanship matters, even in online games.

      "content": "# Tech talk: How to keep the conversation going when they’re online\n\n## Talking to your kids about how they use technology is your way to protect them from online dangers. Here’s how one parent navigates tough tech talks.\n\n\nHow many connected devices are in your home right now? Start adding them up—smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, smart speakers, smartwatches, everything connected to the internet. It’s probably a little more than 20. In fact, today’s homes have an average of 22 connected devices, according to a recent study.\n\nNow imagine that the safety solutions you regularly rely on—content filters, parental controls and screen time limits—suddenly vanish. Would you feel confident in your child’s ability to navigate the internet by themselves?\n\nI’m a parent of five sons and the founder of Parents Aware, which helps parents navigate the tricky parts of a tech-connected life. I find that most parents want their kids to enjoy the benefits of technology. But many worry about what their kids are doing online—especially what they don’t see. They want to keep their kids safe.\n\nMy answer is always the same: Talk openly and honestly with them about the technology they use. Start as soon as children have access to smart devices. Be intentional about what you say, ask for their input and make the conversation ongoing.\n\nBut what does that conversation sound like?\n\n## Start the tech talk early and keep the conversation going.\n\nParents can be the best tech safety feature kids can have. At some point, every child will face a potentially dangerous situation online. And when that happens, they need to know what to do and where to turn for help. Filters and parental controls serve an important purpose, but they can’t teach kids how to safely navigate away from dangerous situations. That’s a parent’s role.\n\nAccording to a worldwide survey, parents spend a total of less than one hour talking to their kids about online safety and security. We can do so much better. The real work—the heavy lifting of tech safety and the place where it all comes together—is in your real-life, daily conversations.\n\nHere’s the best part: You don’t need to be tech-savvy for effective discussion. Instead, start with where your child is in their digital development and what devices they use.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nYour child’s age\n\nWhat to talk about when they first get the device\n\nHow to keep the conversation going\n\n\n## Ages 3 – 5\n\n**The tech they use: **For more than 40% of families of parents with kids ages two to eight say their families use a smart speaker.\n\n**What to talk about when they first get the device: **Talk about how these devices work. Children should know that smart speakers listen to your conversations. It’s how the speaker knows to respond to verbal commands. Point out that the device has microphones built in, and show them where the mute button is to turn off the microphones. Explain that muting the device when you’re not using it is for privacy.\n\n**Keep the conversation going: **Explain the safety benefit of using smart speakers in common areas of the home. Reinforce that technology can be enjoyed as a family. Model using the speaker for very specific tasks, and remind children of all ages that parents are always the best and safest source of information. Let children know you can research answers together with the support of smart technology.\n\n## Ages 6 – 8\n\n**The tech they use: **At this age some kids are getting smartwatches. For these kids, the smartwatch will serve as the introduction to devices they take everywhere they go, from school to friends’ houses.\n\nIt’s so much fun getting that first call or message from your children. And there’s the reassurance of knowing where they are through the GPS tracker. In fact, this is a perfect place to start the conversation.\n\n**What to talk about when they first get the device: **Kids should know that the smartwatch on their wrist tracks their every move. Some models have video cameras, voice-responsive commands and activity trackers. Point out these features on the device and help kids understand what they do.\n\n**Keep the conversation going:** Talk intentionally about who gets added to their contact list and why. What is your definition of a “safe contact”? What is appropriate to send to friends in text, video and phone messages? Even with these precautions, children need to know that any device can be hacked. Suspicious or inappropriate messages are red flags and should always be discussed together. And make it a daily habit to inquire about text messages along with asking about their day at school or play date.\n\n## Ages 9 – 12\n\n**The tech they use: **Smartphones (if you think your child is ready) and tablets.\n\n**What to talk about when they first get the device:** Start with basic boundaries: Who. What. Where. When.\n\n**Who** has access to the phone and its password? You and your child.\n\n**What **gets put on the phone? Start with the basics, talk, text and a few games. Additional features can be added gradually.\n\n**Where **is the phone to be used? Agree that phones and other devices stay out of the bedroom.\n\n**When **is the phone to be used? Discuss phone etiquette and expectations around the dinner table and in other social situations.\n\n**Keep the conversation going:** Even without a browser installed, there are many ways your child could access the internet via their smartphone. That means conversations about pornography and other inappropriate content are now critical.\n\n## Ages 13 – 18\n\n**The tech they use:** Brace yourself—we have entered the teen years. This can be a scary time for parents as you work to balance tech safety with teen autonomy. Some days it can feel as if your teen is shutting you out. Rest assured they need your help and they actually want it—but they need your conversations to evolve. The more input they can give on how to use tech safely, the more they will feel respected and part of the decision-making process.\n\n**What to talk about when they first get the device:** Social media is important to most teens and often serves as an essential link to their social lives. So listen to their requests carefully, then help them decide which service best suits their needs. Start with a single account. As you review the pros and cons together, try to look for as many positives as negatives as you can to be thoughtful.\n\n**Keep the conversation going: **Have frank conversations about cyberbullying, catfishing, sextortion and more. Approach these sensitive topics with concern rather than accusations. Teens are more likely to open up when they feel understood and respected.\n\nIf you ever feel the need to dial back the tech for a while because of poor choices, let teens know that it comes from a place of love and that you are ready to help them get back on track. You never want your teen to hold on to a dangerous secret just so they can protect their access to technology.\n\n## Making tech safety a natural part of the tech experience\n\nSometimes we fall into the trap of thinking that digital safety is a conversation better suited for older kids. The reality is that young children have access to smart devices. Talking to them early on sets the groundwork for more sophisticated conversations that occur during the teen years.\n\nThe general rule is to start the conversation early so that digital safety becomes a natural part of our kids’ experience with technology. Maybe you’ve never thought of it like this before, but you are one of the best tech safety features of your home. You are the only safety feature that can adapt to the situation and mentor your kids to safely navigate their digital world.\n\nSo, what conversation will you start today?",

      "content": "# Parents’ guide to getting started with Discord\n\n## A parent and Discord user shares what parents need to know about this online community and messaging platform.\n\n\nYour kids are just as likely to jump on Discord as they are to text a friend. This digital community is home to group chats for everything from class assignments to gaming strategies. And in 2023, Discord added parental controls to its social media platform—a big shift from its “user-first philosophy.”\n\nIf your kid uses Discord, you’ll need to create an account to use the new parental controls. It’s also essential to keep the conversation going offline about how to use Discord safely. Here’s a few tips to get you started.\n\n## What is Discord?\n\nDiscord is a free app that lets users create a or join an online community. It combines a chat room and an online forum, with the option to send direct messages, or chat via voice and video.\n\n## How does Discord work?\n\nWhen you sign up for Discord, you can create your own community or “server,” add friends on Discord to join that server, or join a public server. A Discord server is the main community space where users can connect over a shared topic. Each server can have thousands of users focused on a topic like Marvel movies, or a specific game like Minecraft.\n\n## How do people communicate in Discord?\n\nMost Discord servers have several different channels within one server. These channels function like a chat room where the community can break off into more focused conversations.\n\nFor example, in the Family Tech server I started on Discord, there’s the main discussion, and there’s a “parenting tech” channel where people can ask specific parenting questions like, “Would you let your child play a Mature rated game?”\n\nIn addition to text, you can also communicate using the following:\n\n**Voice channels:** A group voice call with the option to flip on your webcam to convert the voice call to a video call. Some voice chats are locked and available by invitation-only.\n\n**Direct messaging: **Send and receive direct messages from anyone.\n\n**Live video: **Livestreaming by other users, often integrating other streamers from YouTube or Twitch.\n\n## Parental safety features you need to know about\n\nDiscord applies its own restrictions to users under the age of 18. These include restrictions to block spam, inappropriate messages, or joining any servers labeled NSFW (Not Safe For Work). It’s essential that your child’s age is correctly listed on the app for these features to work. And parents should check out any server—even if it isn’t labeled NSFW—to make sure it’s appropriate.\n\n## How to engage as a parent\n\nFirst, create your own account. Discord has some parental oversight through their Family Center. Once you add your child’s account to your own Discord account from the Family Center, it sends a notification to your child to approve the connection.\n\nFrom the Family Center, you’ll want to check these controls.\n\n**Limit friend requests: **Only allow friends of friends to send your child a friend request.\n\n**Check their messages: **See who your child is messaging and how many voice calls they sent.\n\n**Check the servers they’re following:** Periodically check in and see what servers they joined so you can make sure it’s appropriate.\n\nDiscord combines features from some of my favorite social media platforms. It’s a great way to find your people and talk about things you’re passionate about. I always say, “be where your kid is sharing”—so if your child wants to use Discord, create an account for yourself and see how it works. You may just find your new favorite social media platform.\n\nIt’s the first app for their first phone: Smart Family.",

      "content": "## What is a radio access network?\n\nCell phones use radio waves to communicate by converting your voice and data into digital signals to send through as radio waves. In order for your cell phone to connect to a network or the internet, it connects first through a radio access network (RAN). Radio access networks utilize radio transceivers to connect you to the cloud. Most base stations (aka transceivers) are primarily connected via fiber backhaul to the mobile core network.\n\nA RAN provides radio access and assists to coordinate network resources across wireless devices. Devices primarily connect to cellular network via LTE or 5G NR connections. Silicon chips in the core network as well as the user equipment (like your phone or laptop) help enable the functionality of the RAN.\n\n## What is 5G RAN?\n\nRadio access networks have evolved over the years as cellular technology is now at 5G. Today, RANs can support multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) antennas, wide spectrum bandwidths, multi-band carrier aggregation and more.\n\nThis evolution of RAN for 5G will have a huge impact on wireless technologies, including enabling Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and network slicing. These RANs of the future will also contribute to the lower latency that makes 5G so powerful.\n\nFind out more about Verizon’s 5G network and see how it will have an impact on your life—and on society.",

      "content": "# How to outsmart screen time for a better bedtime routine\n\n## A cognitive specialist explains a hack for your evening to bedtime routines to make the transition from screen time to bedtime as smooth as a lullaby.\n\n\nHow did you sleep last night?\n\nResearch shows that sleep is just as important for children as a healthy diet and physical activity for a developing brain. Yet many children today are dealing with sleep deprivation.\n\nThat’s why, every night, it’s the same routine in our house. At 6:30 PM we shut down screen time and the laptops, tablets and electronic devices go off and into their designated charging station. Then it’s family time—a carefully created serotonin-inducing routine (with a little smart tech built in) that’s designed to help us all get a good night’s sleep. And it works. Even with two brilliant, neurodivergent children whose best friends are electronics.\n\nWhy does it work? Because this evening routine considers how cortisol, dopamine and serotonin work together so that our family time is more rewarding than the screen time the kids would be getting before bed.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s neurotransmitters and hormones. Here’s how you can create a better evening routine for your family.\n\n## Bedtime routines: But first, sleep\n\nWhen you spend an extended period of time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain begins processing and retaining the information that occurred earlier during the day. That’s an important time for children to process everything they learned that day—important developmental and cognitive skills and academic knowledge. Not getting enough REM sleep can impact information retention.\n\nHow much sleep a kid needs is based on age and developmental stage. Since sleep boosts brain development, babies need the most sleep. The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine recommends the following for optimal health:\n\nInfants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps).\n\nChildren 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis.\n\nChildren 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis.\n\nChildren 6 to 12 years of age should sleep nine to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis.\n\nTeenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep eight to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis.\n\n\nModern life, busy schedules and screen time throughout the day can all impact the body’s natural circadian rhythms. And like any rhythm, if the drummer’s off the beat, it can throw off the whole show.\n\nThe circadian rhythm is the natural internal process that regulates the sleep and awake states. These 24-hour cycles manage physical, behavioral and mental changes. Circadian rhythms can influence hormone release, body temperature and digestion, which are essential functions in our body.\n\nHere are some of the key hormones and neurotransmitters affected by the circadian rhythm and how they affect your child.\n\n## Good morning, cortisol\n\nCortisol is responsible for a lot that goes on in your body: It controls your stress response, regulates metabolism and is anti-inflammatory. Levels are highest in the morning. When cortisol levels are out of balance, a child can feel anxious and have attention and focus issues.\n\n## The reward center: dopamine\n\nDopamine helps facilitate communication among the regions of the brain called the “reward center.” It’s also essential for movement and memory. Spending time on screens can boost dopamine levels—for a good reason. Instant gratification from racking up points in a game, or getting that instant message from a friend, feels good. It’s a big reason why transitioning off screens can leave kids feeling cranky or sluggish. That’s also why some kids beg for another five or 10 minutes of screen time.\n\n## Making memories with serotonin\n\nSerotonin is known as the “happy chemical.” This neurotransmitter regulates mood, and when it’s in balance, you can feel happier, calmer and more focused. It’s also the chemical responsible for waking up and falling asleep. When you think back to a happy childhood memory, serotonin kicks in to help you retrieve that memory. Serotonin-inducing activities, such as spending time with a caring parent, help your brain remember: “This is something I look forward to, and I want to do it again.”\n\n## Melatonin to sleep\n\nWhen the lights go off, melatonin kicks in to help you fall asleep. As the sun or light enters the room, your body starts to make less melatonin, so you can wake up naturally. Screens can interrupt this rhythm and fool your brain into not producing enough melatonin, causing you to stay alert longer than anticipated.\n\n## From screen time to bedtime\n\nTeenagers have other hormones interfering with their daily rhythms, but in focusing on the hormones above, this routine works best with most kids under the age of 13.\n\n- 6:30 PM — Turn off all electronic devices and put them into their designated spaces.\n\n- 6:30 to 7 PM — Engage in an activity you’ve planned that kids can look forward to after getting off screens, such as going outside or having a dance party. In our house, we use this time to transition from the work and school day to family time. We’re all working together to get dinner ready, such as setting the table or doing other house chores\n\n- 7 PM — Have family dinner together. At the dinner table, everyone takes a turn talking about their day. That’s when serotonin can kick in as we’re talking together, bonding, building memories, and it becomes something that the kids look forward to each night.\n\n- 7:15 PM — Get ready for bed. The kids go upstairs, brush teeth and come downstairs with a book for us read together. Kids don’t always like to do things such as brushing their teeth. We intentionally stack this type of chore with a reward, or something that they look forward to. So they start to associate something they need to do with something they want to do, which is read together.\n\n- 7:30 PM — Have kids choose their own unwinding activities in their rooms that don’t involve screens, such as reading on their own, or listening to audiobooks or music on smart speakers. And if it’s been an active or stressful day, incorporate some light stretching, using some stretching apps as a guide.\n- 8 PM —Listen to calming sounds on smart speakers before bed.\n- 8:30–9 PM — Fall asleep to favorite sounds as the lights go down and melatonin kicks in.\n\nIt may sound like common sense, but the goal is to ensure that time with you is just as rewarding as screen time. So it’s about creating the kind of bedtime routine that sets up both you and them to make the best of that time together.\n\nSleep well.\n\nTurn off their WiFi and data from one app on your phone—Smart Family.",

This expert-approved guide can help you transform fear into confidence for you and your kid.\n\n\nYou don’t have to dig too deeply to find headlines about the connection between smartphones and increased anxiety in kids. But these headlines don’t help parents.\n\n“This fear-based and guilt-inducing approach paralyzes parents more than it activates them,” says Dr. Michael Rich, Director and Founder of the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital and author of “The Mediatrician’s Guide: A Joyful Approach to Raising Healthy, Smart, Kind Kids in a Screen-Saturated World.” “It’s telling parents that they’ve already failed their kids while offering no real solutions.”\n\nParents aren’t failing, according to Dr. Rich and Bea Moise, a cognitive specialist, parent coach and author of “Neurodiversity and Technology: Neuroscience-led strategies for parents.” Today’s parents are just navigating a system that keeps shifting, which makes it difficult to know what to do next with anxiety in kids.\n\nHere, Moise and Dr. Rich share tips to help parents rise above common pressure points and succeed in today’s digital age.\n\n## Pressure point: Will a smartphone make my kid anxious?\n\nSmartphones often get blamed for anxiety in kids, but the relationship is more complex.\n\n“It’s important for parents to keep in mind that correlation doesn’t mean causation,” says Moise. “Your child can have a healthy relationship with tech, but it needs to be monitored at an age-appropriate level, and they need to know how to use it appropriately.”\n\nTo start, focus on these actions:\n\n- Prioritize sleep. Turn off devices at least an hour before bedtime.\n- Talk about what’s happening inside group chats and online communities.\n- Model tech breaks. Show them what it’s like to unplug.\n\n## Pressure point: What if I give them a smartphone too soon—or too late?\n\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule on this one.\n\n“Not all 14-year-olds are alike, and not all 16-year-olds are alike,” Dr. Rich says. “Readiness is more about how they’re using these tools than about the tools themselves, or the age they are when they start using them.”\n\nInstead of asking yourself if they’re old enough, ask:\n\n- Can they handle a group chat without spiraling?\n- Are they comfortable coming to you when something online feels weird?\n- Do they understand that nothing on the internet is really private?\n\n## Pressure point: Are smartphones rewiring my kid’s brain?\n\nYes—but not always in the way you think.\n\nKids’ brains are naturally wired to adapt, thanks to neuroplasticity. Since neuroplasticity is at its peak during childhood and early adolescence, Moise says that structure and intention can help parents use this time to set their teens up for balance.\n\n“If there’s a household rule of no tech before noon, your child’s brain will wire itself to know that they don’t pick up a phone first thing after waking up,” she says. “We wire the brain … to be adaptable to life rather than … adaptable to tech.”\n\nHow to help wire their brains for balance:\n\n- Set rhythms not just rules, like no screens in the first or last hour of the day.\n- Talk about the “why” behind any screen limits.\n- Be clear about parental controls and why they help support independence.\n\n## Pressure point: Is screen time replacing playtime?\n\nChildhood has changed, but that doesn’t mean creativity is gone.\n\nMoise points out that kids are still imaginative, just in different mediums. They may not build blanket forts, but they’re designing 3D worlds in games like Roblox. Producing music using tools like GarageBand. Telling stories through video, like YouTube edits.\n\nStill, you need to help them find balance between what Moise calls 2D (digital) and 3D (hands-on) creativity.\n\nTry this:\n\n- Watch an online video tutorial together and then try it offline—like drawing, cooking or origami.\n- Ask your kid to teach you something they learned from a tutorial.\n- Support 3D hobbies they can document or build on with tech. For example, painting a mural and filming a time-lapse of the process, making a highlight reel of skateboard tricks, making jewelry and setting up a shop on a private Instagram account.\n\n## Pressure point: Kids will always find a way around the content blocks and filters.\n\nThis mindset can make parents feel powerless.\n\nMoise recommends taking time—whether it’s one week, six months or a whole year—to learn the tech before handing it over.\n\nTry this:\n\n- Use parental controls like Verizon Family Plus, which alerts you if your child tries to change or remove restrictions.\n- Take on the role of a tech mentor, guiding instead of controlling.\n\nYes, anxiety in kids can be overwhelming.

A tech expert and parent explains what metrics he tracks with his kids and why.\n\n\nMy wife and I have always made a healthy lifestyle a priority for our family, focusing on everything from exercise to diet. However, we often struggled to know if our children’s activities had the right impact on the things we care about: Were they getting enough playtime at school? Were they sleeping well? Today, smart technology is helping us keep track of things that matter to us.\n\nAs an IT professor and someone who’s been focused on health and fitness for 30 years, I’ve long used a smartwatch to monitor my own health data. Based on that experience, my wife and I decided to outfit our three children with these devices to better monitor various measures of health and fitness. When I started paying attention to the fitness metrics on my kids’ smartwatches, I was astonished to see how many steps they took per day—it was a lot more than I expected. I also hadn’t considered how fun these devices could be. For example, there were badges for accomplishing various family fitness goals, and we could compete with each other as a family. I knew the technology could be beneficial, but I was amazed by how much information we received about the activity, diet and sleep routines for each of our children.\n\nToday’s smartwatches can track many health data points. Here’s the three categories we check regularly: sleep, heart rate and calories burned.\n\n## Sleep\n\nWe pay attention to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which notes that the American Academy for Sleep Medicine recommends that children between 13 and 18 get approximately 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night, while those 12 and under get 9 to 12 hours. Smartwatches can help determine if your child is sleeping soundly through the night and whether they are waking up frequently.\n\nFor example, we were aware that our youngest child occasionally woke up at night and played quietly in his room, but his sleep data showed that we underestimated the frequency and duration. Based on what we saw, we collaborated with a sleep clinic and his doctor to develop strategies for improving his sleep.\n\n## Heart rate (HR)\n\nStanford University says that some smartwatches can help identify certain heart abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation. This is more than just something important to me—it’s personal.\n\nWhen I was 24, I was diagnosed with a rare, potentially lethal heart defect that I’d had since birth, which required a complicated heart procedure to fix. Given my experience, it is important to me to monitor our children’s heart rates.\n\nUnderstanding our kids’ typical heart rate patterns during rest and during activity is important to us because it helps us understand what’s normal and what isn’t for them. It’s one thing if one of them is watching a scary movie and their heart is racing. But we would consult our family doctor if we started seeing patterns we didn’t understand.\n\n## Calories burned\n\nSmart watches can use data from various daily activities, including step count and heart rate, to estimate energy expenditure and calories burned. I like to think of calories burned as an upgraded version of the step count metric that looks at overall activity.\n\nMonitoring how many calories my kids burn each day can provide valuable insight into their physical activity levels. This metric covers activity all day—not just “active time.” So it’s calculating when they’re running outside, doing chores around the house, bounding up the steps, doing the dishes, or just sitting around. For example, if my kid burns an average of 2,500 calories a day but only burns 1,800 sitting around all weekend in front of screens, I can suggest ways to get them more active.\n\nMy kids are coming of age in a world where health and fitness measures can be tracked—a concept they’ve always been familiar with in our family fitness goals. In addition to discussions about healthy habits with parents and teachers, this can empower children to make healthy decisions from a young age.\n\nKeep an eye on their phone activity, too, with Smart Family.

Due to differing technologies, an unlocked Verizon Wireless device may not work – or may experience limited functionality – on another carrier’s network.\n\n**Postpay Device Unlocking Policy**\n\nDevices that you purchase from Verizon are locked for 60 days after purchase. Devices that you purchase from one of our authorized retailers are locked for 60 days after activation. After 60 days, we will automatically remove the lock unless the device is deemed stolen or purchased fraudulently. Following the 60 day lock period, we do not lock our phones at any time.\n\n**Prepaid Device Unlocking Policy**\n\nDevices that you purchase from Verizon and certain devices purchased from one of our authorized retailers are locked for 60 days after paid activation. After 60 days of paid active service and ordinary usage, we will automatically remove the lock unless the device is deemed stolen or purchased fraudulently. Following the 60 day lock period following device purchase, we do not lock our phones at any time.\n\nIf you purchase a 4G Phone-in-a-Box from one of our authorized retailers, you should review the back of the box to determine the lock period applicable to that device.\n\n**Unlocking Policy for Deployed Military Personnel**\n\nIf you are a Verizon Wireless customer on active duty in the military and receive relocation orders outside of the Verizon Coverage Area, upon verification, you do have the option to suspend your line for Military deployment. Upon suspension, your device will only be unlocked after the account has been verified in good standing after 60 days of being active.\n\n**Updated on: May 22, 2025**",

Here’s what you need to know.\n\n\nSmartwatches for kids have become hugely popular among families who want to stay in touch with their children remotely and help little ones stay safer while keeping screen time to a minimum. An easy tool that travels wristwatch-style with a child, it helps you stay connected with kids ages 3 – 11 without providing them a smartphone.\n\nBut as a futurist, parent and author of “Parenting High-Tech Kids,” I often remind families that the best smartwatch for kids not only brings families closer together and gives kids more room to roam, but also offers other features in addition to calling and GPS trackers. Adding a line to your Verizon plan for your child's first connected device, like a smartwatch or the Gizmo Watch 3, is more than just a technical upgrade—it's a big step toward their independence.\n\nHere, we’ll review kids watches with smart capabilities, the ways the underlying technologies work and why a great smartwatch for kids can be an essential training tool for your children.\n\n## What do kids smartwatches do?\n\nFeatures vary from product to product, but generally, a smartwatch for kids makes calls and sends texts to a pre-approved list of contacts. Verizon’s Gizmo Watch 3 also uses GPS so parents can check the app on their phone to find out if their kid made it on that first walk to a friend’s house or to a nearby playground.\n\nAside from being simple to set up and use, the best smartwatch for kids should boast added features such as games, fitness trackers, alarms and reminders. It should also feature a touch screen and an emergency contact option. Some kids’ smartwatches may also offer video-calling or videoconferencing capabilities.\n\nHere’s what many of today’s kids smartwatches can do at a glance:\n\n- Wireless audio and/or video calling\n- Texts and voice notes\n- Parental controls (aka safety controls)\n- GPS location tracking\n- Geo-fencing (boundary setting) with real-time alerts\n- Apps and games\n- Alarms\n- Reminders\n- Step counters\n- To-do or task lists\n\n## Why a smartwatch for kids may be the best smartphone alternative for a first device\n\nIf your child is too young or not ready for a cellphone, a smartwatch can be a great smartphone alternative. That’s because smartwatches can serve as training wheels of sorts when it comes to connected technology for kids. Parental controls limit whom the child can text, call or send photos to, along with other helpful features like easy-to-review messaging and call history. This can provide a great way to introduce children to the world of technology while limiting their web exposure.\n\n## Four things to seek in a smartwatch for kids\n\nEvery family has different needs, but for ages 3 – 11 (the general age range for a kid-friendly smartwatch), there are four key features parents should seek:\n\n**1. GPS tracking**\n\nAmong the most important capabilities that many units offer are GPS trackers for kids that provide real-time location options so that parents can stay aware of their children’s movements. With these watches, you can also set up geo-fencing to establish GPS boundaries—such as a school or a friend’s house in your neighborhood—and alert parents or caregivers when the child crosses those boundaries. For many parents, the ability to locate their child when they’re on the move is a priority. Plus, if your kid loses track of the device from time to time, GPS makes it easy to find it, much like the Find My Phone feature on your smartphone.\n\n**2. Safety features**\n\nAs with any device created for young children, check the device’s parental controls for the ability to limit access to the internet and whom they can message, and make sure the device is protected with a strong PIN or password. Likewise, you’ll want to configure any privacy settings, usually found in device settings menus or individual apps, to minimize the amount of information that you’re sharing with smartwatch makers and third-party application creators.\n\nThe best smartwatch for kids will likely offer two-way communications capabilities, so you’ll also want to teach children when and where it’s appropriate to use such a device, how to communicate respectfully and with whom it’s okay to speak. It may also offer SOS or “panic mode” features, complete with alarms, GPS alerts, and automatic audio or video recording. You’ll want to teach kids how to use these features responsibly.\n\nFor safety’s sake, you may wish to choose a kids watch model that limits connectivity to websites, social media networks and the internet at large.\n\n**3. Durability**\n\nConsider how durable or waterproof a device is, noting that it will travel with kids as they play and go about their day. Kids may forget to charge their devices at regular intervals, making it important to pick a model with long battery life and a sturdy charger. An intuitive user interface is also important, as an easy-to-use unit will make it simpler for kids to use and stay in touch. Screen size is worth keeping in mind as well, as it makes reminders and notifications more obvious, on screen alerts and buttons easier to select, and information easier to read.\n\n**4. The fun part: step trackers and interactive games**\n\nPicking a smartwatch for kids with calorie-, heart rate- and/or step-tracking features can help you promote and encourage good fitness habits. Fitness features will differ from one model to the next but often will include capabilities such as activity trackers, fitness apps, daily goals and to-do lists. Some let you record your voice with fun filters and send texts, emojis and voice messages. Remember, kids are built to play. Whichever unit you choose, look for features designed with kid’s play in mind to help bring out the fun.\n\n## How to pick the best smartwatch for kids: balance fun and responsibility\n\nBefore choosing a device, take time to consider how you’ll be using it. For example, will your kids use it when they are away at school—or when out and about in the neighborhood? It’s also important to consider what features you think your kids are ready for (video calling, internet use, etc.).\n\n## Kids smartwatch hints and tips\n\nA smartwatch for kids is effectively a computer that travels on a child’s wrist. Here are a few added pointers to keep in mind as you go about managing and maintaining these advanced high-tech devices:\n\n- Keep software and safety and security features up to date.\n- Avoid connecting to public wireless networks if possible.\n- Regularly review new apps and device features to understand their capabilities.\n- Limit downloadable applications’ access to personal information sharing.\n- Take time to configure parental controls, alerts, safe zones and GPS tracking.\n- Understand devices’ photo, video and audio recording capabilities and teach kids to use them responsibly.\n\n## Finally, ask your kids what they want when you’re picking out the best smartwatch\n\nChoosing the right smartwatch for kids often becomes much easier when you get kids involved in the buying process. Ask them what fashion and style they prefer, what high-tech features they’re interested in, and what types of applications they’d like to use. The more children feel like active participants in the process, the greater the likelihood they’ll actually wear and use the device without you having to remind them constantly. Similarly, the cooler kids perceive device apps and features to be (like the goal-driven fitness challenges, swappable watch faces and avatars, etc.), the more fun they’ll have with those features.\n\nPicking the right kids smartwatch is a combination of your individual family’s needs, budget and preferred features. Luckily for anyone shopping for a smartwatch for kids, you’ll find no shortage of options that split the difference, many of which you can add quickly and easily to your existing cellphone plan.\n\nNow that you’re an expert, check out the Verizon Gizmo Watch 3 – Adventure.\n\nAn award-winning professional speaker, Scott Steinberg is among today’s best-known trends experts and futurists.

Would he use it well? Would he be safe? Would we lose him to his phone? Instead of focusing on the worries, we decided to reframe the moment as an opportunity for growth and connection. We found that our kid thrived on the freedom that his first phone allowed. We also realized that he, like many kids, is more willing to open up about tough subjects on a text thread than face-to-face.\n\nMy family isn’t alone in this—experts agree that a phone can strengthen our bonds with our kids. The key is to set expectations around this important milestone so that the experience is a positive one for everyone. Wondering how to make that happen? Here, parents and experts share five simple steps you can take with your kid’s phone as soon as you hand it over to them.\n\n## 1. Set boundaries with your kid’s phone—your kid still needs them.\n\nKids may roll their eyes at the idea of boundaries around using their first phone, but they’re necessary. “Parents often have strong expectations when it comes to kids’ phone usage, but they might not communicate those expectations to their kids in advance,” says Michelle Icard, author of “Fourteen Talks by Age Fourteen” and other parenting books. She says it can be hard to dial back freedom after the phone has been given—making the timing of setting those boundaries especially important. “These are issues best discussed and managed before the phone gets in the child’s hands.”\n\nMolly Williams, mom of 10-year-old twins, did just that last year with her kids’ phones. The kids knew the rules—including that their parents could check their phones at any time—well in advance. “We’ve had long talks about not putting anything on a phone you wouldn’t want your grandma and the president to see,” she says.\n\nEach family will have different values and concerns, but it’s important to touch on key topics:\n\n**Parental controls:** Share that parental controls will be in place on the kid’s phone and decide what the consequences will be if those controls are removed.\n\n**Social media:** Discuss which social media apps are okay and set rules for creating and managing accounts, including privacy settings and who they can connect with.\n\n**Password protection:** Encourage your child to create strong, unique passwords for their accounts and to keep passwords private, even from close friends.\n\n**Regular check-ins:** Let them know that you expect to have regular conversations about their online experiences. Ask them to share what apps they’re using and who they’re talking to, creating an open dialogue about their digital life.\n\n**Location sharing:** Decide together whether it’s appropriate to use location-sharing features. If those features are turned on, ensure that location is only shared with family members or trusted individuals.\n\n## 2. Text with your kid\n\nIt seems obvious, but texting with your kid is one of the main reasons many parents provide a child with that first phone. Coordinating pickup from activities or being available when a child might need help in an unsafe situation are the main reasons we got our child a phone, and they top the list for most parents. What might be surprising? That texting can be a window into your kid’s world (have you heard kids’ slang?).\n\n“The best advice I got was not to diminish the things they find interesting,” says Jamie Kenney, a writer and mom of two. “Staying engaged while listening to them talk about some esoteric meme lore is boring, but it’s not to them.”\n\nKenney’s son is more willing to open up about sensitive topics via text, which she counts as a win. “The phone has provided us insight into his interests, humor and thoughts,” she says. “As we enter the teenage years, I think that’s invaluable.”\n\n## 3. Define no-phone zones\n\nJulia Cook, who writes children’s books on topics including tech safety, says kids need firm guidance about the right times to use their first phone. “There is always a right time and place,” Cook says. “It’s important for kids to know that nothing is more important than the people right in front of you.”\n\nIcard says mealtimes and car rides can be great no-phone zones for the entire family. Those moments around the table or driving to sports practices are some of the best times for connection. “Kids need to learn they don’t always have to be available to their friends by text or social media,” she says.\n\nIt’s also important for parents to stick to the guidelines they set for no-phone zones. Kids should not be using phones during school, so don’t text them during the school day unless it’s absolutely necessary. And don’t have your phone at the dinner table if that’s one of your no-phone zones.\n\nOther helpful no-phone zone options:\n\nAny mealtime\n\nDriving to sports practices together\n\nDuring school\n\nFamily movie nights\n\n\n## 4. Model good phone habits\n\nThis builds on the no-phone zone idea: Kids learn more about life by watching their parents than through anything parents might say to them, so it’s important for parents to model the behaviors they want their kids to adopt in their phone habits. If you create a no-phone zone at the dinner table but can’t help checking your email during a meal, that sends a message to your child that the rules don’t matter. The same can be said for distracted driving, slinging unkind words online or zoning out while your kid is trying to share an important part of their day.\n\nCook says kids are watching how we use our phones—constantly. Make sure you pay attention to your phone behavior. In particular:\n\nPut your phone away when you drive.\n\nDon’t text and drive.\n\nIf your kid is talking to you when your phone dings, ignore your phone.\n\n\n## 5. Check in regularly\n\nWilliams says they have no regrets about giving their kids their first phones—they’ve actually found their relationships improving with open lines of communication. “Our kids know their phones are a privilege, especially at their age,” she says, “and they are very respectful of the rules.”\n\nAt the same time, kids’—and parents’—needs, expectations and experiences are constantly evolving. And that’s why the experts say the tech conversation can never be a one-time chat. It needs to be an ongoing, regular conversation.\n\nThat can look like:\n\nHaving a monthly family meeting to discuss technology. This can be a scheduled time when parents can educate kids about internet safety, as well as a time for kids to raise concerns.\n\nConducting screen-time reviews. Family members can share screen-time reports and discuss how the amount of screen time may be affecting their lives—positively or negatively.\n\nDiscussing requests for new apps or social media access. Openly discuss any requests you aren’t comfortable with. Develop a plan and timeline for each new step.\n\nKeeping the lines of communication open. It’s always okay for kids to bring up a tech concern or safety issue—even if the issue is that they made a mistake.\n\n\n“Parents can’t anticipate every rule they might need,” says Icard. “So ongoing conversations and flexible learning around phone use need to be embraced by parents and children alike.”\n\nIt’s the first app on their first phone: Smart Family.\n\nMeg St-Esprit, M.Ed., is a journalist who writes about education, parenting, tech and travel. With a background in counseling and development, she offers insights to help parents make informed decisions for their kids. St-Esprit lives in Pittsburgh with her husband, four kids and too many pets.\n\n\n*The author has been compensated by Verizon for this article.*",

The Service shall also include any software or hardware that we provide you in connection with the Service to which you have subscribed. Verizon Business DSL Service utilizes transport service provided by your local Verizon telephone company. If you change your local telephone company, or move your local telephone service to a wireless service provider we may in our discretion either terminate your account or continue to provide DSL service at existing rates terms and conditions. If your local Verizon telephone company provisions transport service to your location utilizing fiber optic technologies, we may in our discretion terminate your DSL Service. In cases of such termination, we will offer to you Verizon Fios Internet Service for Business and we will disclose to you applicable rates and additional terms, if any, that may differ from the DSL Service provided under this Agreement.\n\n**2. Term. **This Agreement shall be effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement, as provided above, and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, it shall continue on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party as permitted by this Agreement. We reserve the right to terminate the Service (or any part thereof) in the event we cease to offer the Service. If we cease offering the Service (or any part thereof), we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice. Billing on your account will begin following completion of provisioning of DSL Service.\n\n**3. Prices. **Prices are guaranteed for the Initial Term of Service. For any Service offered on a month-to-month basis, we will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice of a price change.

If your charges are billed by your Verizon local carrier, the Late Fee will be equal to the late payment charge that the local exchange carrier applies. If your charges are not billed by your Verizon local carrier, you agree to pay interest of 1.5% for each month or part of a month (or the maximum interest allowed by law, whichever is less). Verizon may assign unpaid delinquent charges to a collection agency for action. If Verizon uses legal action to recover monies due, you agree to reimburse Verizon for all expenses incurred to recover such monies (including attorney's fees). You also authorize Verizon to conduct a credit search which we may use to determine your credit worthiness.

At the written request of a party, each party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The parties intend that these negotiations be conducted by non-lawyer, business representatives. The location, format, frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may mutually agree to utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as confidential information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any lawsuit without the concurrence of all parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications that are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.\n\nc. If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of the initial written request, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. A party may demand such arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in those rules. Discovery shall be controlled by the arbitrator and shall be permitted to the extent set out in this section. Each party may submit in writing to a party, and that party shall so respond, to a maximum of any combination of twenty-five (25) (none of which may have subparts) of the following: interrogatories, demands to produce documents and requests for admission. Each party is also entitled to take the oral deposition of one (1) individual representing another party. Additional discovery may be permitted upon mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration hearing shall be commenced within sixty (60) calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in Fairfax County of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The arbitrator shall control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The parties may submit written briefs. The arbitrator shall rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of hearings. The times specified in this section may be changed upon mutual agreement of the parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n\nd. Each party shall bear its own costs of these procedures. A party seeking discovery shall reimburse the responding party the costs of production of documents (to include reasonable search time and reproduction costs). The parties shall equally split the fees of the arbitration and the arbitrator.\n\n16. ** Limitation of Liability**. IN NO EVENT SHALL VERIZON OR ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR (A) ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO DATA ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (B) ANY CLAIMS AGAINST YOU BY ANY THIRD PARTY.\n\n17. ** Limitation of Damages.** OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY NON-INSTALLATION, SECURITY BREACH, FAILURE OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO CHARGES PAID BY YOU UNDER THE APPLICABLE SERVICE AGREEMENT DURING THE PERIODS WHEN SUCH CLAIM AROSE.

Publicity. **Customer shall not use any trademark, trade name, trade dress or any name, picture or logo which is commonly identified with Verizon or its affiliates, or from which any association with Verizon, or its affiliates may be inferred or implied, in any manner without the prior written permission of Verizon.\n\n**23. Choice of Law.** You and Verizon agree that the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, will be applied to govern, construe and enforce all of the rights and duties of the parties arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement. YOU AND VERIZON CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN A COURT LOCATED IN FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA FOR ANY SUITS OR CAUSES OF ACTION CONNECTED IN ANY WAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TO THE SERVICE. Except as otherwise required by law, including Virginia laws relating to consumer transactions, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Service must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is barred.\n\n**24. Miscellaneous. **The terms and conditions of this Agreement supersede all previous agreements, proposals or representations related to the Service. You may not assign this Agreement without our prior written consent. We may freely assign this Agreement. Any changes to this Agreement, or any additional or different terms in your purchase orders, acknowledgments or other documents, will not be effective unless expressly agreed to in writing by us.

If any of the terms or conditions in this agreement are properly found to be invalid or unenforceable by a government body, the remaining terms or conditions of this agreement shall not be affected by the finding and shall continue to apply as necessary to reflect the original intention of the parties. Verizon's failure at any time to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any right or remedy available hereunder or at law or equity, or to exercise any option herein provided shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision, right, remedy or option or in any other way affect the validity of this Agreement. The exercise by Verizon of any rights, remedies or options provided hereunder or at law or equity shall not preclude or prejudice Verizon from exercising thereafter the same or any other rights or remedies or options.\n\n*GTE.Net LLC d/b/a Verizon Internet Solutions\n\n4055 Corporate Drive, Suite 400\n\nMC: GA1A05, Legal Dept.\n\nGrapevine, Texas 76051\n\nThe following additional terms apply to DSL Service with static IP, dynamic IP Services (\"DSL Service\") (and bundles containing this DSL Service):\n\n**25.

      "content": "# Digital bullying and exclusion: How to keep our kids emotionally safe while they’re home\n\n## Parents: Plant the seeds of a movement that replaces cyber-bullying with cyber-compassion.\n\n\nSocial distancing is hard on all of us, but it’s especially difficult for kids.\n\nFor many, their friends are their whole world. Think about the last time your child wanted to hang out with their friends, and their disappointment or even distress if they couldn’t.\n\nWhen you’re a kid, being cut off from your friend group can be like losing a lifeline. For most students, this period of social distancing and the transition to home-based learning will be challenging enough. For bullied students who were already feeling cut off from the support of their peers, it may sting even more.\n\nThen there are the bullies. Bullying is rarely a targeted act of aggression. The bully is usually a hurting child acting out in a cry for help. If the source of that bully’s pain is emanating from the home, and school was their only escape, imagine how much more desperate that cry may become and the behavior that could follow?\n\nWith crisis comes opportunity and what’s happening in our world with the coronavirus is no exception. We will all be forced to communicate, convene and connect more virtually during this time of disruption. This is an opportunity to teach our children better digital citizenship and to set an example by practicing it ourselves.\n\nIt’s time to give our kids a whole new way of looking at their devices and apps. This is an opportunity to plant the seeds of a movement that replaces cyber-bullying with cyber-compassion.\n\n## Here are some specific suggestions on how you and your children can be ambassadors of change:\n\n- Brainstorm with your child three ways that they could use texting, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter or other social/digital media to connect with someone at school who struggles to fit in and make them feel included.\n\n- Have your child start a text-chain of encouragement in which he or she texts or Snapchats something positive and uplifting once a day to as many of their classmates as possible.\n\n- If your child is bullied or excluded, help them reach out via digital media to cousins, neighbors, children of your co-workers the same age, and encourage regular communication and creative activities they can share online.\n\n- If you have little ones in elementary school, arrange “virtual play dates,” that might include putting on “video plays,” enjoying word games, and other activities live via social media, Skype etc.\n\n- If your child is feeling especially isolated during this time, jump on the internet with them and look for online communities and forums for youth that focus on an area of interest to your child, whether that may be amateur fossil hunting, theater, creative writing, fan clubs, whatever it might be that excites and engages your child. Note: research and vet whatever online groups your child wishes to join before giving your permission.\n\nWe will get through this. In the interim, help your child feel connected to their peers however you can. They are depending on you and I know that together, we got this.\n\nLearn more about Verizon's response to COVID-19.",

Beyond being an exciting addition to your family, a new furry friend can help you teach your kids some crucial skills related to responsibility and time management. And there’s smart tech that can help make it easier and more fun.\n\nHere are five ways to incorporate digital technologies into your family’s pet care routine that can help your kids become responsible pet owners.\n\n**Start with your smartphone or smartwatch. **A tech-forward approach to pet care can start with your existing smart device. For example, you can use the built-in timer tool on your phone or watch to make sure your new dog gets outside for a potty break at regular intervals. You can even use your device’s built-in step-counter to track and set goals for your daily walks.\n\n**Try this:** Schedule daily dog walks and assign the walks to members of your family with the built-in calendar app on your phone. The recommended number, length and intensity of daily walks will depend on your dog’s age, breed and energy level—but according to the American Kennel Club, new puppies should generally get 2 – 3 short (10-minute) walks a day as they build their stamina and leash skills.\n\n**Track your pet’s location with GPS.** Did the cat get out? It happens. Smart collars mean there’s no need to panic, since you can easily track your pet’s location using the smart collar’s GPS capabilities. Pete Scott, president and CEO of the American Pet Products Association, notes that today’s smart collars offer much more than GPS, including features like geo-fencing—the smart collar’s answer to the electric fence—that can be helpful for dog owners. If you’re spending time at a friend’s house or going to the park, you can now create your own automatic fence for the dog that sends a pulse vibration to the dog’s collar—and alert you—any time they go outside the area you’ve approved.\n\n**Don’t forget:** Confirm that the pet tracker you choose is compatible with your wireless network.\n\n**Check on your pet.** While previous camera models were primarily designed to detect human intruders, more recent models can detect the difference between a person, a pet or a car. The camera has built-in night vision, too, so you can check on your pet at night. You can even grant older kids access to the camera view so they never have to wonder what the cat is up to when you’re away.\n\n**Try this:** Find out if your pet day care or boarding service has pet cameras, in-app messaging and other tech-forward options. That’s a capability Scott says he and his wife prioritize when seeking out care for their dog, Tucker. “We’ve even made decisions away from specific pet boarders because they didn’t offer a tech-enabled connection,” he says.\n\n**Try a connected approach to pet health.** Pets are great at letting you know when it’s time to eat, but it’s much harder for them to let you know when something is wrong with their physical health. That’s where smart pet tech comes in—with smart bowls, mats and collars that can keep track of your pet’s nutrition, weight and activity level.\n\n**Try this:** Ask your vet if they can recommend pet care health tracking devices. According to Scott, using smart tech for pet care can mean fewer expensive trips to the vet. “With the latest advances in pet tech, we have a way to communicate data back to veterinarians, who can now see if the pet is getting enough exercise, if they’re eating enough and if their nutrition is solid,” he says. “As a result, veterinarians don’t need to see the pet as much in the office, since they’re receiving health data on a regular basis.”\n\n**Stream, Fido, stream! **Can dogs benefit from watching TV? Scientists say yes! According to more than 50 studies conducted at universities from Oxford to UC Santa Barbara, exposure to music and visual media has been shown to help dogs relax, offer much-needed mental stimulation and even support timid dogs in building their confidence.\n\n**Try this:** Subscribe to DogTV. The streaming service provides relaxing shows and music specifically for your pet. You can also find pet training videos and learn more about pet care. With one subscription, you can stream on-demand content for dogs and people, across all your devices.\n\nPet care technologies can go a long way toward ensuring your pet’s health, safety and well-being, but of course there’s no substitute for quality time spent with their favorite people.\n\n“Today’s technologies make it possible for pets to get a treat or a stream of water with the push of a button … but they’re still living beings that thrive on that animal-human bond,” says Scott. “When you get home from work and your pet goes bonkers—there’s no tech that can substitute for that.”\n\nIt’s a digital parent’s (second) best friend: Verizon Smart Family.\n\nAudrey Smith is a multimedia journalist, public media producer and former high school English teacher whose writing focuses on tech, AI and digital literacy for kids.\n\n\n*The author has been compensated by Verizon for this article.*",

      "content": "# Gaming for good digital citizens\n\n## Most parents hold the back of the seat when their kids are learning to ride a bike; the same should be true for teaching them how to navigate their identity online.\n\n\nWhen my oldest daughter began requesting a social account, she was too young according to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act—COPPA. Disregarding my objection (and the law), she decided to create her first digital identity by falsifying her age. Within a day, my social account recommended I follow her because we shared common connections, and so I decided to use this as a teachable opportunity.\n\nI set up an account with a pretend name and used an image online from her school to convince her to follow me back. I began sending messages and requested to meet her after school. Unaware of the potential danger she was in, she agreed. Before we ever had a chance to meet, my husband spilled the beans in frustration. We talked about how easy it was to convince her that I went to her school and how unsuspecting she was with virtual connections.\n\nNow, more than ever, our students have expanded their digital identity online because of virtual learning, social media and gaming. Every digital activity (Twitch account, videos viewed on YouTube, etc.) marks new data about the child, extending their digital footprint in any online action. While digital activity increases, the dangers—such as hacked accounts, child exploitation and online scams—are rapidly growing. These concerns should be a reminder of the need to teach how to use the power of online connections for good.\n\nThe journey to learning must involve both child and caregiver working together. Digital exploration shouldn’t be done alone but instead as a family. As Dr. Marialice Curran explains,\n\n*“Just like learning how to ride a bike, our children need us to run next to them as they figure out how to balance and be independent. As part of digital parenting, it is critical for our children to have someone holding the back of the bike seat as they set out on their online journey.” *\n\n*Dr. Marialice Curran, Digital Citizenship Institute founder and co-editor of DigCit Kids: Lessons Learning Side by Side to Empower Others Around the World.*\n\n## Play to learn together\n\nAs the demand for more education on digital literacy grows, the delivery is most beneficial when the child is fully engaged. In other words, they learn better when they’re having fun. Games with a focus on learning about digital citizenship create a positive learning experience. Not only are children more immersed with the content, but the retention increases because they enjoy the lessons while spending long periods playing.\n\nHere are a few games you can play together, or with the whole family. Be mindful that the games are just one opportunity to become digitally literate. The goal is to empower our children to use technology for positive change. Not only can our children do incredible work, but they are also a valuable resource to teach us parents. Many children naturally have more technical knowledge than we give them credit for.\n\n## For parents and kids\n\n**Interland**\n\nThe “Be Internet Awesome” initiative by Google was first intended for educators to teach kids digital safety that’s essential for learners. Still, healthy online habits need to be practiced both at home and school. With the rapid changes in technology, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and want additional support. The guide is intended to support families to navigate good digital habits and includes the interactive game Interland.\n\nThe online game is focused on five core values: be smart, alert, strong, kind and brave. The child can jump to different islands, learning a new value in each challenge. The games teach the child how to avoid problems online and ways to successfully overcome obstacles. The challenges are somewhat tricky, even for an adult, but the repetitive reminders of good digital citizenship are ingrained in your child’s mind by the time the games are completed.\n\n## For families\n\n**bCyberwise**\n\nAnother game that reinforces healthy online habits is the bCyberwise Monster Family by Life Education Australia. The iOS and Android app is a lovely adventure into the digital struggles that many families encounter. From connecting a router, establishing secure passwords, making good choices with social posts and accessing online content safely to using respectful communication, the bCyberwise app is full of learning adventures. The playfulness and relatability of the characters make this a refreshing treasure, but good luck putting down your device.\n\n## For students and children\n\n**Belouga**\n\nUsing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Belouga platform was born to build a community for students worldwide (Belouga is intended for students and children, but parents can access the new portal coming this fall). The mission is to make learning accessible, impactful and equitable for all children through interactive collaboration content aligned to subject area, age, standards and the SDGs. The learning platform and community, active in over 120 countries, are fueled by a passion for innovation to help create a sustainable impact worldwide.\n\nAfter a year of scrambling to bring educational content to our children, Belouga began developing a parent portal, scheduled to release this fall. With a focus on providing parents the ability to guide, educate and engage in their children's learning, the new features were created by parent feedback. These features lean heavily on the social aspect of learning. Parents can create digital learning pods for their children while having full access to the content and creation assets. All content and learning experiences will continue to be tailored toward the child’s interest, age and core subject area. With the support of the parents, children are encouraged to build positive connections across the world, developing global citizens to make a significant difference in our communities both on and offline.\n\nGrowing in digital literacy should move beyond the don’ts and progress into the do’s with the support of the caretakers. While many children will learn about digital citizenship in school, the real journey begins at home. Digital responsibility isn’t only about avoiding dangers but also about building vibrant, safe communities that, when equipped, can change the world.\n\nGet ongoing tips and expert advice about Parenting in a Digital World.",

My kids each had one when they were 10 and 12, and we used the watches to introduce portable tech into our home. I also used the Gizmo Watch to guide them toward independence—with just enough structure and supervision to help them as they figured things out.\n\nAnd that’s the biggest takeaway: Kids don’t build healthy habits without help. Smartwatches can support independence but only when paired with guidance. The Gizmo Watch is an excellent tool for helping kids build responsibility and confidence while giving parents peace of mind.\n\nWhen it comes to figuring out how to use the watch to do that, I lean on neuroscience-based techniques that help kids develop real independence through consistent use. Here’s how.\n\n## 1. Set expectations: You’re thinking safety. They’re thinking fun.\n\nBefore you hand over the Gizmo Watch, set clear guidelines and expectations for when and how it should be used. These guardrails can be helpful: Neuroscience shows that predictability reduces anxiety and helps kids feel more in control.\n\nIn our home, the expectation was that the Gizmo Watch was a tool for connection, not distraction. From the start, we told our kids: “This is a test for how you’ll interact with a device that’s with you all the time.” And then we shared some basic rules:\n\n- We expect devices not to interfere with family activities.\n- We expect devices not to be used during times that require presence, like restaurants, playdates and family events.\n- We expect texts to be answered at an appropriate time, and we promise not to text during school hours.\n\n**Gizmo Watch task: Create a Gizmo Watch agreement.** Make a checklist of when and how they should use the device. These expectations will evolve, so ongoing conversations and check-ins are important.\n\n## 2. Let the reminders come from them, not you.\n\nShow your child how to set reminders for chores, homework and activities using the watch. Then let them take over. This helps build self-monitoring skill, part of what experts call executive functioning, or the brain’s management system. These are the skills kids use to plan, focus, stay organized and follow through. Over time, as they get better at remembering and starting tasks on their own, they could feel more confident and need fewer nudges from you.\n\n**Gizmo Watch task: Make three daily tasks together**—one for a chore, one for homework and one for fun (like “draw for 15 minutes”). At the end of the week, ask which task helped the most and what they’d change.\n\n## 3. Let the check-ins come from them, not you.\n\nConstant check-ins from you can feel like micromanaging, but the Gizmo Watch can become a tool for check-ins that they control. When your child finishes a task, they can send you a message or call to let you know. That small action builds responsibility—and confidence—and can keep you from becoming a micromanager.\n\n**Gizmo Watch task: Choose one kid-initiated-check-in each day.** For example: “When I finish my chore, I’ll send a voice note that says, ‘Done!’” If they miss it, don’t prompt them right away. Talk about it later to build trust.\n\n## 4. Don’t rush in to fix a mistake—ask what they’d do first.\n\nWhen your child forgets a task or misses a deadline, pause before jumping in. You might say something like: “What ideas do you have for handling this?” or “How can you use your watch to remind yourself next time?”\n\nConversations like these can help build critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.\n\n**Gizmo Watch task: When a mistake happens, use the watch to problem-solve for next time.** Have your child record a voice reminder in their own words, like: “Start homework before snack.”\n\nThe Gizmo Watch can be more than just their first connected device. It’s a tool for building independence, responsibility and time management skills. With a little structure and the right strategies, you can help your child take ownership of their time—and feel good doing it.\n\nYou’re there for them with Verizon Family. Verizon’s there for you—with an industry- leading 3-year price lock*.\n\n*Learn more about our 3-year price lock guarantee.\n\nScreenshot this for later\n\n## Gizmo Watch tips for raising self-starters:\n\n- Set clear expectations before giving your child the Gizmo Watch. Predictability builds confidence.\n- Let kids set their own reminders. It builds executive function and self-starting habits.\n- Use check-ins to build trust. One message a day from them is more powerful than 10 from you.\n- Don’t jump in to fix mistakes. Ask how they’d handle it—and use the watch to plan ahead.\n\nverizon.com/parenting\n\nBeatrice (Bea) Moise, M.S., BCCS., is a Board-Certified Cognitive Specialist, parenting coach, national speaker, and author of Our Neurodivergent Journey.

Learning to text can also support the development of various skills and relationships, including text etiquette, quick typing, a greater awareness of how to convey and interpret tone, and more meaningful connections with trusted adults.\n\n“Kids are going to make mistakes, and it’s best if they happen with the people that already love and care about them,” says Christine Heverly, a Children and Youth Programming educator with Michigan State University Extension in St. Johns, Michigan. “That way, mistakes can also be opportunities to discuss what could be done differently next time.”\n\nKid-safe tech and devices such as the Gizmo Watch 3, which now has a touchscreen QWERTY keyboard but can only text a pre-approved list of contacts, can help give kids a safe introduction to texting. Here are a few strategies and helpful tips to try from educators and experts who’ve used them with their own kids.\n\n**Early on, limit your child’s text messaging to family members.**Encouraging your child to text with extended family members, especially trusted adults who live far away, can expand their circle. With the Gizmo Watch 3, you approve the contacts they can text, too. When establishing this connection, be sure the family member is aware of any times (such as during school) when your child should not be using their device.**Remind kids to pause before they double-text.**After your child has sent a text, remind them to give the other person time to reply rather than sending two (or three or four) follow-up messages. This helps normalize the idea that replies aren’t always immediate. It’s also a good idea to talk through the many reasons why someone might not reply to a text message right away.**Read text messages out loud with your child.**Reading a message aloud, using various tones and points of emphasis, can help demonstrate the many ways of interpreting a single message. Unlike a face-to-face conversation, text messages don’t include clues like facial expressions or tone of voice. Meg St-Esprit, M.Ed., a counselor and journalist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, uses this strategy with her own kids as a way to distinguish jokes from more serious messages. “I find that we as parents are often acting as translators,” she says. “For example, we say things like, ‘I think if you read it this way, maybe it would make more sense.’”**Talk together about notification settings and what’s appropriate.**This can be a great way to help your child develop contextual awareness around their tech use. For example, it’s important to choose notification sounds that aren’t startling to others, and to discuss contexts—such as school or family activities—when a device should be set to silent or turned off. The Gizmo Watch 3 has several ringtones to choose from, as well as a School Mode that minimizes distractions from Gizmo when your kid is at school.**Talk with kids about screenshots.**We live in the era of the screenshot, so it’s important to communicate to kids that nothing they send over text can be completely erased, even if they’ve deleted it from their own device.**Watch how you talk about texting.**The way parents talk about technology in front of kids matters, especially if we want them to come to us with tech-related conflicts or concerns in the future. St-Esprit says, “If we are constantly railing against tech and acting as if we have to grudgingly allow them to use it, they may not feel they can bring issues—like an online bully or creeper—to us.”**Make time for them to disconnect.**Texting is a great way to connect with friends and family, but it’s also important to spend time away from devices and make space so others can do the same. Establishing specific tech-free times can help counteract the message that we should be endlessly available—especially when parents commit to modeling these behaviors themselves. “It’s worth it to set up strong boundaries from the start about when and where phones are used at home,” Heverly says. “For example, at my house, phones don’t go anywhere at night other than our family’s designated charging station.”\n\n## How the Gizmo Watch 3 supports kids learning to text\n\nGuiding kids through their first texting experiences is much easier with the Gizmo Watch 3, which includes various features that help kids communicate safely and effectively:\n\n**A new QWERTY keyboard update**allows users to develop typing skills as they compose text messages in their own words instead of using preset responses.**A group-messaging function**on the Gizmo Watch 3 makes it easy to stay in touch with extended family. Parents create groups in the GizmoHub app.**School Mode**disables all features except the SOS button, which allows voice calls to the child’s primary emergency contact.**A limit of 20 pre-approved contacts, including the watch’s primary guardian,**lets kids communicate only with the people you’ve designated in advance.\n\nGuide your kids through their first texting experiences with the Gizmo Watch 3.\n\nAudrey Smith is a multimedia journalist, public media producer and former high school English teacher whose writing focuses on tech, AI and digital literacy for kids.\n\n\n*The author has been compensated by Verizon for this article.*",

      "content": "# What is TikTok?\n\n## Time to brush up on your 15-second dance moves.\n\n\nIf there’s a pre-teen in your house, there’s a good chance you’ve been hearing about TikTok videos. The social media app is getting more attention and more downloads these days than Instagram and Facebook, and it’s internationally popular—especially with kids ages 8–12. Even late night talk show hosts are getting in on the game. And tech and media watchdog sites like Common Sense Media are keeping an eye on the app, too.\n\nYet, what is the creative value, and what are the parental controls with TikTok? And what do parents need to know about the new video-sharing app?\n\n#### What is TikTok?\n\nTikTok is a social media app designed for creating and viewing short-form videos. Formerly known as Music.ly, it features content created by the community, primarily lip-sync videos, loops, memes and comedy pieces. The bite-sized content (3–60 seconds in length) is ready-made for increasingly short video attention spans—Magid’s 2019 Mobile Lifestyle Study found 30% of kids 8–12 watch short video clips six times a day or more compared to just 12% of total mobile video viewers. Intended to be easy to watch, binge and explore, TikTok offers a seemingly endless inventory of videos relatable for many teens and pre-teens.\n\n#### What are the age requirements?\n\nMost social media services require users to be 13 or older. The TikTok terms of service do not specify an age requirement, but those who indicate that they are under the age of 18 are required to obtain parental consent to use the app. While children under the age of 13 can download the app and have access to view video content, they are not allowed to upload videos, create a profile or message other users. They can only view videos. Age is self-reported by users.\n\n#### What are the safeguards?\n\nThe five user protections and safeguards outlined below are the standard for trusted social networks. Know what they are and how to use them for any social network your child accesses. Note that TikTok now offers all of these features. Links provided below are to the relevant settings within TikTok.\n\n- Account Privacy – Setting your account to private allows only your followers to see your videos.\n- Contact Management – Privacy controls offer options for allowing community members to comment, direct message or duet with you.\n- Restricted Mode – This permits you to manage your child’s experience by filtering potentially inappropriate content in addition to the app’s interface. You can take the following steps to turn on Restricted Mode in TikTok:\n\n1. Open the app and tap the Me icon in the lower right corner of the app.\n\n2. Tap the three-dot icon in the upper right corner.\n\n3. In the Privacy and Settings menu, tap Digital Wellbeing.\n\n4. Turn on Restricted Mode.\n\n- Inappropriate Content Reporting – Content that does not comply with community guidelines can be flagged by users.\n- Safety Center – A robust safety destination that provides guidelines, parental tips and safeguard information, how-to’s and FAQs. We recommend visiting the TikTok Safety Center for complete information on the app’s privacy settings, safety features and additional resources.\n\n#### Talk to your kids about their social apps and how they use them.\n\nThe best way to ensure an app is safe for your kids is to be familiar with it and how your child uses it. This seems simple, but kids often have hours of experience with an app that adults haven’t heard of or know how to use. However, while kids may know how to use apps, they still need your mentorship, as explored by Devorah Heitner in Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in a Digital World. Encouraging your kids to share content they like with you will help you understand how they engage with the service and prepare you to identify and address any parental concerns.\n\n#### Set limits and restrictions.\n\nBanning your child from an app is generally not an effective solution since it can cause more frustration than compliance. If safety or excessive use are concerns, try to set limits or dangle access to the app as a reward. This can establish parameters while keeping your kids’ social experience positive.\n\nEngaging your child with tech can yield great benefits, but only you know the right parenting decisions for your kids. Putting forth the effort to ensure that your child’s engagement with social media is safe will result in a positive digital experience for them and your family.\n\nFor related media inquiries, please contact story.inquiry@one.verizon.com",

Learn how to spot it, when to step in and how to teach teens to respond.\n\n\nMaybe you’ve seen a social media post like this: A sad-looking selfie with a vaguely worded caption such as “feeling sad.” There’s a term for posting pictures like this to get instant attention: sadfishing.\n\n## What is sadfishing?\n\nSimply put, sadfishing is when a person posts a sad story or image in order to receive more comments or reactions. The term comes from “phishing,” the online scam where someone tries to “fish” information out of you, like a phone number, email or home address. Sadfishing is similar, but it’s fishing for sympathy, not data.\n\nSadfishing can show up in a social media post, a private message or a group chat. Much like the false alarms in the story of the boy who cried wolf, posting too many sad, vague pictures will eventually backfire. The more a person sadfishes, the less interaction they’ll get. As with any addiction, this diminishing return could be damaging to mental health—which is why parents need to be aware and educate themselves on helpful approaches to any reaction.\n\n## Examples of sadfishing\n\nGenerally, a sadfishing post is highly personal and heavy on emotion. For example:\n\n**The sad selfie. **The image shows the person crying, looking sad or off to the side. The caption is about life being super hard, or something even more vague, like “not again.”\n\n**Sad content.** This could be a quote from a famous person, movie or song, maybe even a random quote. There’s usually a sad background, too—such as a touching nature scene—to amp up the emotion. Maybe “I’m so tired,” with a photo of someone making lemonade from lemons. Or simply something like “Sometimes all you need is a best friend, a long talk and lots of tears.”\n\n**Too much information. **These posts are loaded with lots of details about struggles and could include a photo of the person at the hospital or in the doctor’s office.\n\n## How do you know if your teen is sadfishing?\n\nAs a responsible parent, it’s helpful to follow your kids on social media so you can spot opportunities to help guide age appropriate choices on social media.\n\nIf you see a post like the ones described, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re sadfishing. If your kid breaks an arm and posts a photo from the hospital or doctor’s office, they’re probably just sharing what’s happening in their life. (But this may be a good opportunity to talk with them about their online identity and why many health-related issues might best be kept private.)\n\nBehavior starts to drift into sadfishing if your kid is vague about why they’re sad, or if the post doesn’t match up with what you know is happening in their life. For example, they might share a photo from a doctor’s office, but they haven’t been to the doctor in months. A notable characteristic of sadfishing includes obsessively checking a post like this for comments and likes.\n\n## What parents can do about sadfishing\n\nMost sadfishing posts fit into one of three levels. Each level involves you stepping in and to spend some one-on-one time with your kid, but without bringing up their specific post as the reason you’re reaching out.\n\n**Low level: Searching for attention.** These posts are sad, vague and frequent, but your kid may still seem content–and even happy–off-line. Consider helping to provide this attention, directly and indirectly. For example, setting aside time, such as a regularly scheduled “date,” to hang out with your teen. Let your kid take the lead on these outings, but let them know that they’re loved for exactly who they are. Show genuine interest in their activities and what they love. Or, suggest and help foster bringing one or two of their friends together for an event or activity on a manageable regular basis which may help ease any lack of attention they may be feeling.\n\n**Medium level: A cry for attention.** These posts stand out from what they typically post and can feel a little uncomfortable to read or emotionally charged as they over-share about a personal struggle. Maybe your teen is struggling with a particular topic in school, or they’re being bullied. Make time to talk with them about what’s going on and ask specific questions, like “Do you like all your teachers? Which one is your least favorite?” or “I haven’t seen you hanging out with Maddie lately, are you guys OK?”\n\n**High level: Making references to self-harm or other extreme behaviors.** These should be taken very seriously and with the right sense of urgency based on the nature of the posts. Seek expert guidance and help from the right mental health professional immediately.\n\n## How to talk with your teens about sadfishing\n\nEven if your teen isn’t sadfishing, it might be a good idea to talk to them about it during one of your regularly scheduled “dates.” You can help them understand what sadfishing is (and that it could backfire) and even how to spot it in their friends’ posts. Remind them that sadfishing can attract online predators or others looking to take advantage of vulnerable teens.\n\nAlso let them know that the best way to handle a friend’s sadfishing post is to respond to the person, not the post. What that means: Teach your kid, if they see a friend sadfishing,to reach out directly and say, “Hey! Let’s try to get together to hang out soon! We haven’t hung out in a while!”\n\nIn discussions with your kid, let them know it’s OK to be sad, but sadfishing isn’t a solution to the problem. After all, the more someone sadfishes, the less people will believe them, which is the opposite of the reaction the person is trying to get. Remind your teen that if they’re lonely or sad, they can spend time with friends, find ways to boost their self-esteem offline or ask for help. And they can always come to you.\n\nKeep an eye on their phone, without looking at their phone, with Smart Family.\n\nThe more often someone sadfishes, the less interaction they’ll get. The diminishing returns could be damaging to a teen’s mental health. Sadfishing can attract online predators looking to take advantage of vulnerable teens. It could also be an indication of a personality disorder.\n\nIt can be. It may be more helpful to your teen directly instead of reacting to the post. Schedule one-on-one time to discuss what’s going on, but don’t make the post the focus. Instead, focus on the teen. If the post references self-harm or other destructive behavior, seek expert help with the appropriate sense of urgency.\n\nSarah Kimmel Werle is a digital parenting coach and family tech expert.

      "content": "# How to use Smart Family to manage screen time\n\n## Kids are spending more time online, but you can set screen-time limits, see what they’re doing online and even block content in real time with Smart Family. Here’s how.\n\n\nWe’re all spending more time on screens today, blurring the line between quality and quantity. We try to make screen-time rules for kids, but that’s easier said than done: What’s too much for the aspiring YouTube influencer? Or the preteen set on being a professional gamer? Or the next AI innovator? Sometimes we just need our kids to shut down their phones long enough to make the bed.\n\nFortunately, there are ways to create and enforce screen-time rules and there are specific tools that can help parents reinforce boundaries. One of them is Smart Family, offered by Verizon—an application that helps parents manage their children’s digital lives. Install the Smart Family app on your phone, and install the companion app on your kids’ phone, and you can set screen-time limits, access parental controls, track their location using GPS and even pause the internet—all from your phone.\n\nHere are a few ways you can use the app to help manage your kid’s screen time.\n\n## Set time restrictions.\n\nThe first step to managing screen time is setting limits on when kids can use their devices. The app lets parents designate certain time periods as either School hours or Night hours, each of which allows access to only certain functions.\n\nSchool mode stops calls, texts and social media access. You can also lift the calling restriction for a specific number, such as an emergency contact. School mode can be set to allow access to specific websites, such as Canva, that students may need for schoolwork.\n\nNight Hours simply turns off all Internet access. These time restrictions can be scheduled once to just set it and forget it. But if you need to pause access for something one-time, on the fly, just tap “Add a time restriction.” You can manage all of this from your device, without asking your kid to hand over the phone.\n\n“My favorite thing to do is to pause it on the weekends before they wake up, then unpause it after they’ve done their chores,” says Sarah Kimmel Werle, a contributing writer to Verizon’s Parenting in a Digital world, digital parenting coach and IT specialist who uses Smart Family with her children. “Or if they get grounded, or if I need them to concentrate on something else.”\n\n**Where to find time restrictions in the app:**\n\nScroll down to the Manage controls section and tap Limits.\n\n## Block unwanted app and site access.\n\nThe Smart Family app includes content filters that let you block specific sites and apps, or categories of apps. For example, you can block games, social media and messaging. These restrictions can be adjusted as kids develop healthier screen habits.\n\n**Where to block app and site access in the app:**\n\nOptions for internet and site-specific blocks are available in the Content filters section of the Manage controls section of the app.\n\n## Track and see online activity and usage reports.\n\nYou can also see exactly how your kids are using their devices. Activity reports in the app show you what kind of content your kids are consuming, and how much time they’re spending on specific things like social media, gaming, watching videos and texting. You’ll receive a weekly email that summarizes who the child is texting or calling, and whether or not it’s a trusted contact; when they enter a new phone number; and when they visit a site or app with increased frequency.\n\nYou can also get a notification if your child visits a questionable site, and from the app on your phone you can open the link and decide whether to block it in real time or let it go.\n\n**Where to find tracking reports in the app:**\n\nGo to Activity and Insights to access reports.\n\nEven if the classifications of screen time are getting a little blurry these days, you can get some clarity on how your kids are using their devices. Then talk together about anything you may find problematic. The definition of quantity over quality screen time—it’s up to you and your family.\n\nSet the screen-time limits that work best for you and your family, with Smart Family.",

But there are better ways to get there. Switching up the tech every hour or so—using a mix of audiobooks, music with headphones, screen-time activities and tech breaks—can soothe eye strain and boost feel-good hormones like serotonin.\n\nHere are my four tips to make your next trip a better experience.\n\n## Cool gadgets for traveling with kids\n\nBackbone Mobile Controller Bundle for Android\n\nBackbone Mobile Controller Bundle for iPhone\n\n**1. Start road trips with screen time: Smartphone, tablet or gaming console**\n\nAt the start of road trips, let kids choose their screen-time activity. For mine, that usually means watching educational programs on a tablet for kids (more about headphones later) or playing a game on their smartphone. If there’s a gamer in your house, you can use on the trip. We limit screen time to hour-long intervals to reduce eye strain. After the first hour, we switch to another activity.\n\n**2. Take 20-minute tech breaks with road games**\n\nMaking the switch from screen time to off-screen time is hard for kids—especially since screen time causes the brain to release dopamine. The transition is easier when kids can look forward to the next thing, like playing a game, reading a favorite book or connecting with a parent or friend.\n\nWe play road games that encourage looking out the window and off into the distance, inspired by this guidance to prevent digital eye strain: Take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes.\n\nHere are a few great road trip games we use:\n\n- State the Plate: If we’re driving from North Carolina to Florida, for example, we’ll see who can spot the first Florida license plate.\n- Counting Cars: How many 18-wheelers will we see in 20 minutes? How many red cars? How many pickup trucks?\n- States Away: Look for a license plate from a state nowhere near your home state, like Montana if you live in Vermont, or Florida if you live in Alaska.\n\nBose QuietComfort 45 Headphones (white)\n\nBeats Fit Pro Noise Canceling Wireless Buds\n\n**3. Switch it up with noise-canceling headphones and earbuds**\n\nAfter a road game, kids can listen to music or podcasts on their wireless headphones. Both of my children prefer Bose QuietComfort 45 Headphones. From my perspective as a parent, the sound quality is great, and the noise-canceling features and volume control are essential for protecting their developing auditory systems.\n\nMy husband usually drives and gets full control of the radio. Personally, I love listening to podcasts, especially educational ones, but not everyone wants to listen to that. So I love using noise-canceling earbuds, too. I also have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and eliminating background noise helps me focus and decreases my anxiety, which can increase the quality of travel.\n\n**4. Take step challenges at rest stops with smartwatches and activity trackers**\n\nWe’re all a little competitive when it comes to our daily step counts. So we’ll take walking breaks at rest stops or nearby parks and see who can rack up the most steps by the end of the drive. And then we just repeat the whole schedule when we get back in the car again, until we arrive.\n\nI started putting this road trip schedule into the kids’ Gizmo Watches, and they love using the timers to know when it’s time to switch things up. It gives them an important role to play on the drive.\n\nUnplugging is also a big part of traveling with tech. We have quiet dinners with no distractions. The Gizmos are on school mode, phones are away, and my smartwatch and phone are set to “do not disturb.” We all enjoy the moment knowing that tech is an excellent addition to the experience, but not the experience itself.\n\nKeep them safe at home and on the road with Smart Family.\n\nBeatrice (Bea) Moise, M.S., BCCS., is a Board-Certified Cognitive Specialist, parenting coach, national speaker, and author of Our Neurodivergent Journey.

      "content": "# How parents can use a smart speaker as a homework helper\n\n## From setting study timers to playing math games, parents share some proven strategies for using a smart speaker as a homework assistant.\n\n\nWhen Anton Range was a kid, he’d reach for a set of encyclopedias and a dictionary for homework. Now a father himself, Range’s own kids—ages 6 and 8—don’t look things up the same way. They ask a smart speaker.\n\n“We live in an age where my kids say ‘Hey, Alexa, what is the largest animal in the world?’” says Range. “And Alexa will tell them and show them a picture of it.”\n\nSmart speakers are now part of the daily routine. The number of users and number of times they get asked to do something a day is going up, according to recent studies. Voice commands play music, check the news and weather, and ping people to finish their to-do lists. So it’s no surprise that a growing number of Gen Z and Gen Alpha children—and their parents—are using smart speakers as homework assistants.\n\nSo what are some innovative ways parents are using smart speakers to help kids do homework? And what do parents need to know to help their kids use them safely?\n\n## Set structure and study reminders\n\n“In our house we use the smart speaker as an alarm for the kids to wake up to, but also as a reminder for them to switch tasks,” says Jill Rosengard about her 15-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son. “Using the intercom, I can drop into one of the kids’ rooms. If they’re listening to music on their phone, the smart speaker reminds them to move on to something else, like homework.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, Rosengard says, when her children had to adapt to a remote school experience, she suddenly needed to create routines to keep her children engaged and learning while she worked from home.\n\nNow, with many students back in the classroom, parents and caregivers are still using voice assistants to set structured study time and reminders. In addition, smart speakers can help busy kids stay on schedule by reminding them of upcoming quizzes, research projects and additional class activities.\n\n**Try this:** Timers are known to help kids with ADHD stay on track, and in some cases can improve test scores. If your child is struggling to focus, try setting a smart speaker timer for five minutes of uninterrupted focus on one task. Increase the time as their attention span expands.\n\n## Learn math concepts\n\n“The new way they teach math is nothing like how I was taught math,” Range says. “I use a smart speaker to find out more about math concepts like distributive property, so I can help my son.”\n\nUsing voice assistants can support a parent and child’s knowledge of math. However, parents like Range don’t want their kids just to ask a smart speaker for an answer. They also want them to learn how to think through mathematical concepts.\n\n“So my wife and I are steering him away from using the smart speaker for math questions,” Range says.\n\n**Try this:** Instead of asking a smart speaker for the answer, parents can help kids enhance their math skills by using smart speaker skills or apps that offer a variety of math games.\n\nFor example:\n\n## Hands-free engagement of the senses\n\n“They’re spending so much time in front of the laptop screen and the smart phone screen,” Rosengard says about her teen daughter and tween son. “I like that it’s non-screen engagement for content. This allows them to hear music, get answers and communicate in a hands-free, no-screen way.”\n\nJenny Finerty also tries to regulate screen time for her two sons, ages 7 and 10, by encouraging them to use a smart speaker instead of screens.\n\n“In our house, my husband and I limit screen time quite a bit. They only get it on weekends and it’s a set amount,” says Finerty. “But I don’t count anything they’re listening to audibly as screen time. Before bed, they’ll each listen to a story on a podcast to go to sleep. And while they’re playing, they’ll listen to music, and I love the idea of that.”\n\n**Try this:** Use a smart speaker as part of the nightly routine to help kids get a good night’s sleep and be more rested during the school day.\n\nNo screen bedtime routine for kids under 10\n\nNo screen bedtime routine for teens\n\n## Practice vocabulary and learning new languages\n\nSmart speakers can also help kids who may be struggling with spelling. Whether it’s learning a new language or learning how to spell, speakers can help a child prepare for spelling quizzes and tests.\n\n**Try this for example:** Need help boosting vocabulary and reading, or learning a new language?\n\nScreenshot this for later\n\n### Safe smart speaker study tips\n\n- Review the device’s user manual and parental controls and explore content filter options.\n- Create a strong password and PIN.\n- Change the wake word frequently so your child learns to ask you for permission to use it.\n- Consider keeping the smart speaker in a family room or the kitchen, and make it a practice to use it only when an adult is present.\n\nverizon.com/parenting\n\nWhile the smart speaker may replace that set of encyclopedias, parents say the devices ideally work as virtual assistants for school assignments, but they don’t replace the assistance of an instructor or simply learning how to study.\n\n“I think smart speakers can play the role of a homework assistant, but I don’t think it can replace a tutor,” Rosengard says. “But it can replace or supplement a reminder and give them the answers they are looking for when parents aren’t available.”\n\nAnd for Range, voice assistants are just one tool he uses to help his kids learn to study.\n\n“Children still need a foundation of good study habits, and shouldn’t use smart speakers as a crutch,” says Range. “Voice assistants are a resource, but don’t use this as the only source. It’s one of your tools, but it’s not the only tool.”\n\nReady to add a smart speaker to your homework routine? Shop here.",

      "content": "# We need to stop talking about the years our kids lost in school.\n\n## One pandemic-era educator shares what she sees from her side of the screen: When we talk about the learning losses from the pandemic, we need to consider the gains, too.\n\n\nYesterday, my 5-year-old students received a self-love challenge in the form of QR codes that were strategically placed throughout their activity books. The QR codes lead to videos that they can respond to with videos of their own. It was all their idea. Everything. The QR codes, the animated meditations and the ability to respond to me via video. Five-year-old children came up with that. There is a tremendous difference between the children I am teaching now and the ones I taught before the pandemic, and I must say that I’m incredibly proud of them.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I spent years as a digital nomad working for the Peace Corps, traveling the world and immersing myself in some of the best education systems to see what we could learn from them. That led me to South Korea, where I taught through two pandemics: the H1N1 virus in 2009 and MERS in 2015. In my experience, many of our children were taught within standard educational practices that were systems passed along year after year. Today’s students were being prepared for the same futures that our own educational systems prepared us for. They had outdated systems that struggled to keep up with current-day educational demands.\n\nPhoto credit: Brian David\n\nHowever, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, educational leaders worldwide were forced to shift and create learning that reflected the moment, thus providing children with an opportunity to learn in a way that compelled them to not only fully experience their current world, but to also prepare for the world they would actually live in, rather than the same futures their elders prepared for.\n\nI have witnessed conversations among other educators, education enthusiasts and parents regarding learning loss and how much our children have missed during our collective crisis. However, when I am in the classroom experiencing my students first-hand, I can’t help but marvel at how much they’ve gained.\n\nIn fact, the following are three ways our children have soared that stand out the most.\n\n**1. They’ve embraced digital citizenship.** Children today are more connected than we ever were, and because of this instant digital connection they learn to interact and be responsible with technology in ways that we never had to. Five-year-old children, like my students, are cognizant of ways to utilize Artificial Intelligence, and for them it’s as simple as saying, “let’s make QR codes.”\n\nThey are also more comfortable on camera and have gained digital learning skills that some adults have gone their entire professional lives without ever having to learn before the pandemic, such as how to conduct a video call. In fact, several of my students use their tablets to have co-playing sessions with their friends. A “co-play” session is similar to a “coworking” session that entrepreneurs often have, in which a group of participants may join a video call for 90 minutes simply to silently work together for accountability.\n\nYou’d be surprised by how much your young one has learned first-hand or picked up by observing family members working from home.\n\nWays to celebrate the win:\n\n**Incorporate the “before and after technique.**” We are taught at a young age to simply focus on how much we don’t know or what we can’t do, so the “before and after technique” helps us to keep all of our gains in perspective. This approach to a conversation is a great way for us all to really take note of how much we’ve grown, adapted and persevered. I recommend acknowledging “before and after” conversations weekly.\n\nFor example: “Wow, Stacey! Before the pandemic, you mainly used your tablet for games and to watch YouTube. But, after learning from home, you now use your tablet to have play dates with your friends, chat with your teacher and even learn how to play chess! I’m so proud of you!”\n\n**2. They’ve embraced global citizenship. **The pandemic is the first time during many of our lifetimes that every country in the world has shared a collective experience. This, along with being on lockdown during several other social crises, has created a sense of compassion and empathy.\n\nIn fact, experiencing the world as both digital and global citizens has provided our young people with a deeper connection to individuals beyond their communities. Research suggests that shared suffering creates a form of “social glue” that is conducive to people feeling more connected. They are not only aware, but they care. Our children have more compassion, empathy and geographic awareness. They’ve identified that places far away have people who have and are also suffering, and this connection is greater than any storytime or history book could have ever presented.\n\nWays to celebrate the win:\n\n**Ask a child “How were you a great ambassador today?” **This question refers to ways in which they have represented themselves and their communities both in person and online. It reinforces digital responsibility and reminds them that both intentions and impact matter.\n\n**3. They’ve embraced their emotions.** In order to help our children cope and to empower them as much as possible, parents and teachers worldwide have had more conversations with young people regarding their emotions than ever before. We’ve discussed the differences between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset, how to be upstanders, and ways to relieve stress and anxiety. Our children are more emotionally intelligent than we were, and the benefits of not only being able to handle one’s own emotions, but to create space for others transcends far beyond what any academic achievement ever could.\n\nWays to celebrate the win:\n\n**Add emotional praise into the family conversation.** Providing conversation around mental health and one’s emotions helps to solidify their importance and allow young people to feel truly seen.\n\nConsider compliments such as:\n\n“I love how much you’re leaning into your creativity these days.”\n\n“I noticed you taking a deep breath to avoid getting frustrated today. Well done.”\n\n“I saw you listening to music to relax a bit before doing your homework, and that’s great for your mental health.”\n\nOur children experienced a form of experiential learning that enriched their lives in ways that we never could have prepared for. Sure, many schools were not able to fully cover pre-arranged lesson plans. However, the actual learning that our children received were lessons that they needed to navigate their current world, which further prepares them for the world they will actually live in: A world that needs its future leaders to be digital global citizens who embrace their emotions and continue to push humanity forward.\n\nI do not believe that our children are behind. The last few years may have been tough, but our kids were, and continue to be, much tougher.\n\nHelp kids celebrate the gains and prepare for the world they’re going to live in with Verizon Innovative Learning HQ, offering free resources, next-gen curriculum and more.",

      "content": "# Transforming a Texas school district with technology\n\nIrving Independent School District is the first in the nation to feature Verizon Innovative Learning in all its schools.\n\nAuthor: Marcia R. Pledger\n\nStephen Austin Middle School student Cecelia Leal fixes a broken tablet. (Photos: Roadell Hickman)\n\nNothing feels ordinary in Anna Trevino’s eighth grade afternoon math class at Stephen Austin Middle School. There are no rows of seats filled with quiet students, no teacher standing at the front of the classroom lecturing. There is, however, a photo of the assistant principal doing the dab projected on a big screen. It turns out, the dance move—which involves pointing one arm toward the sky and bowing into the opposite elbow—is the perfect kid-friendly opportunity to illustrate the process of calculating angles.\n\nStudents chatter constantly as they work on real world math. Some sit alone. Some sit in huddles of two and three, claiming spots all around the classroom. Some hold yardsticks.\n\nAnd all of them work on tablets. And so does Trevino, who uses the Classroom app to see her students’ work in real time and offer immediate feedback and assistance.\n\n“Teaching used to be about mostly sitting still and listening to the teacher. This might look like chaos, but silence no longer equals learning,” says James Tiggeman, digital learning coordinator for Irving Independent School District—home to Austin Middle School—during a surprise visit to the class. “Sometimes noise means students are learning. I wish my math teacher taught like this.”\n\nJames Tiggeman, digital learning coordinator for Irving Independent School District, talks about the improvements he’s seen in the Texas district since 2017.\n\n## A new reality\n\nThat’s the current situation for 8,000+ students in the Texas district. In 2017, five middle schools in the district joined Verizon Innovative Learning, which provides much needed technology and internet access paired with STEM-focused programs. Two years later, the district’s remaining three middle schools joined, uniquely positioning it to show just how transformative this program is for students and the adults who support them. It’s the only district in the nation with 100 percent of its middle schools participating in Verizon Innovative Learning.\n\nSince 2017, students at Irving’s middle schools have seen an overall increase in their Texas state exam scores in science, math, reading, writing and social studies across the board. And a student poll shows that the majority of middle school students in the district feel comfortable with using the tablets provided by Verizon Innovative Learning and find them beneficial to their education.\n\nMeanwhile, enrollment is up by approximately 10 percent at each of the middle schools.\n\nSuperintendent Magda Hernandez says the wraparound support provided by Verizon Innovative Learning is key to academic progress in her districts. “It is an honor to have all of our middle schools participating, and it is extremely important because it provides equal access and full student digital inclusion across all middle schools. Modeling and promoting a learning environment where innovative ideas thrive and risks are taken is critical for success,” says Hernandez. “Verizon Innovative Learning has allowed our teachers and students to take full advantage of the ubiquitous, ‘always on’ nature of the internet and played a vital role in the district’s strategy to transform the teaching and learning process. We have a vision of becoming the best school district in the nation, and promoting innovation through this partnership brings us one step closer to realizing that vision.”\n\nStephen Austin Middle School.\n\n## Support matters\n\nAngela Smyers, district digital learning coach at Lorenzo de Zavala and Austin middle schools, taught elementary school for 31 years before she applied to coach via Verizon Innovative Learning. She loves that the students all have internet access and a device they can use at home. But what impresses her most is that Verizon offers extensive professional development for its 12 coaches and the teachers they train.\n\n“They’re not just saying here’s 1,000 iPads, see you later,” she said. “Twenty-two years ago, our district went one-to-one with laptops at all of our high schools—we’re talking about 10,000 laptops. But there was no professional development on how to use them instructionally, and it failed,” Smyers explains. “I knew this program would be successful because there was a two-year plan before we even started. And it had multiple layers involved with coaches, principals and all of the schools working together. I applied for this position because I wanted to be part of something great.”\n\nVerizon Innovative Learning coach Apryl White and district digital learning coach Angela Smyers.\n\nApryl White, the Verizon Innovative Learning coach at de Zavala Middle School, says Smyers played a key role in bringing her school into the program in 2019. Now, not only does White feel empowered by the mentoring, but she says students are mirroring that behavior and helping each other more. She calls the programming “a game-changer.”\n\n“Our students are in relatively low-income households, so when they go home, a lot of them don’t have access to the internet. So Verizon partnered with Digital Promise to give students data,” White says. “Before they got the devices, their learning was cut off at 3:45 p.m.\n\nNow they have access to one teacher’s web page, another teacher’s YouTube videos with tutorials and another teacher’s Google Classroom.\"\n\nBut make no mistake, the goal has nothing to do with simply being paperless. Smyers adds: “It’s never been about the technology. Everything is about changing our teaching and improving student learning.”\n\nCarlos Turcios updates a series of laptops.\n\n## Future dreaming\n\nWith students aged 11 to 14, accidents are bound to happen. So while tablets have eliminated the excuse of a student’s dog eating their homework packet, a chewed-up tablet is a brutal reminder that some excuses are real. Jeremy Green, Austin’s campus technician, fixes many of the devices himself, but he’s also trained a dozen students to help.\n\nIn the small, crowded tech room, 12-year-old Cecilia Leal bows her head over a tablet with a shattered screen. Within seconds, she’s used a magnetic screwdriver to detach tiny screws, and a flat metal tool to lift the screen. She smiles when asked how she managed to join the tech team a month after other students were already in place.\n\nJeremy Green, Austin Middle School’s campus technician, helps Cecelia Leal with a device repair.\n\nHer teammate Selena Morales plans to be a surgeon and says Verizon Innovative Learning has helped her get better grades, because she has more resources. “I also realize now that technology can help me with my future because technology is used in surgeries with surgical robots,” she says.\n\n“This program is a huge confidence booster. Yes, they’re learning tech skills, but they’re learning so much more,” Smyers says as she beams at two 13-year-old boys repairing a cord. “Any company can teach skills, but they want to know if people can work on teams together. Can you get along and co-exist with others? Confidence built here transfers to real life.”",

      "content": "# Binding Corporate Rules\n\nVerizon maintains a list of the participants of its Binding Corporate Rules and their contacts details.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Binding Corporate Rules Processor and Controller Policies establish the approach taken by Verizon Business Group (“Verizon”) to the protection and management of personal information, in accordance with the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, when it is transferred from the EU or UK to a third country.\n\nThe lead supervisory authority for Verizon's EU Binding Corporate Rules is the Irish Data Protection Commission. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is the supervisory authority for Verizon's UK Binding Corporate Rules.\n\n## International Transfers under BCRs\n\nGuidelines from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) require companies to assess whether transfers of personal data out of the EU are adequately protected in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation and to put in place such additional safeguards they consider necessary. Since then, the US administration has made certain changes to rules around US intelligence-gathering, primarily to support the EU/US Privacy Framework, and as a result international transfers to the US under Verizon’s Binding Corporate Rules and other adequacy mechanisms now benefit from those safeguards, which are contained in Executive Order 14086.\n\nFollowing the EDPB guidelines, Verizon has reviewed its Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) and the transfers of personal data that are made under the protection of the BCRs. Verizon evaluates whether additional safeguards are required to protect the personal data when it is transferred out of the EU and UK under the BCRs by assessing the legal regimes in the countries to which it transfers personal data and by completing transfer impact assessments to quantify the risks of such transfers. Appropriate steps, such as additional safeguards set out by the EDPB or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), will be taken to minimize any identified risks.\n\nVerizon’s EU BCRs are reviewed annually by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) as part of the established review cycle. Verizon has acted on guidance from the DPC on changes to Verizon's EU BCRs to take account of the EDPB guidelines and the DPC has approved Verizon's updated EU BCRs, available below. In its role as the lead supervisory authority for Verizon’s EU BCRs, the DPC acts on behalf of the EU data protection authorities.\n\nVerizon has obtained approval from the ICO to use UK Binding Corporate Rules for Controllers and Binding Corporate Rules for Processors, which are formed using the UK Addendum to the EU Binding Corporate Rules. The UK Binding Corporate Rules ensure the adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred out of the UK.\n\nVerizon is satisfied that the BCRs meet the current requirements.\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules Processor Policy\n\nThe Binding Corporate Rules Processor Policies (“Policies”) establish the approach taken by Verizon to the protection and management of personal information1 globally when Verizon group members (\"Group Members\") process2 that information on behalf of a third party or another Group Member, and where such personal information originates from Europe (including the EEA and Switzerland) or the UK, except where your contract states otherwise.\n\nThe Policies are an appropriate safeguard, or adequacy mechanism, as set out in GDPR Article 46. They apply to all personal information originating from Europe and the UK when it is collected and processed as part of the regular business activities of Verizon in the course of providing services to a third party or to another Group Member (equally referred to as the \"customer\" in the Policies). Group Members and their employees must comply with and respect the Policies when collecting and processing personal information in their capacity as service providers.\n\nVerizon has adopted UK Binding Corporate Rules formed using the UK Addendum to EU Binding Corporate Rules, and therefore transfers of UK-originating personal data are protected to the same standards as set out in Policies.The Policies do not replace any specific data protection requirements that might apply to a business area or function.\n\nDownload the UK Binding Corporate Rules Processor Summary (PDF)\n\nDownload the Full EU Binding Corporate Rules Processor Policy (PDF)\n\n1 Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person in line with the definition of “personal data” in EU Regulation 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.\n\n2 For the purposes of this Policy reference to the 'processing' of personal information is as defined in EU Regulation 2016/679 GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and references to 'collection' 'use' and 'transfer' are all elements of the definition of processing.\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy\n\nThe Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policies (“Policies”) establish the approach taken by Verizon to the protection and management of personal information1 globally by Verizon group members (\"Group Members\") when processing2 that information for their own purposes and where such personal information originates from Europe (including the EEA and Switzerland) or the UK.\n\nThe Policies are an appropriate safeguard, or adequacy mechanism, as set out in GDPR Article 46. They apply to all personal information that is processed in Europe and the UK (which means that it will also include personal information collected by Group Members outside Europe and sent to Group Members in Europe and the UK ) which is then transferred from Group Members within Europe and the UK to Group Members outside Europe. Group Members and their employees must comply with and respect the Policies when collecting and processing personal information for Verizon’s own purposes. The Policies apply to all such personal information processed by Verizon, for example (i) in the course of customer and supplier management, and (ii) which relates to employees and contractors.\n\nVerizon has adopted UK Binding Corporate Rules formed using the UK Addendum to EU Binding Corporate Rules, and therefore transfers of UK-originating personal data are protected to the same standards as set out in Policies. The Policies do not replace any specific data protection requirements that might apply to a business area or function.\n\nDownload the full EU Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy (PDF)\n\nDownload the UK Binding Corporate Rules Controller Summary (PDF)\n\n1 Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person in line with the definition of “personal data” in EU regulation 2016/679 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.\n\n2 For the purposes of this Policy reference to the 'processing' of personal information is as defined in EU Regulation 2016/279 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and references to 'collection' 'use' and 'transfer' are all elements of the definition of processing.\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules Participant List\n\nBelow is a list of companies which are participants of Verizon’s EU Binding Corporate Rules and Verizon's UK Binding Corporate Rules, including contact details for those companies.

      "content": "# Intuit Terms and Conditions\n\n**THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AND OURS, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE VERIZON WEBSITES AND WEBLISTINGS SERVICES.**\n\n**PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.**\n\nThese Terms of Service (\"Agreement\") are entered into between you (referred to as \"you\", \"your\" and \"Customer\") and Verizon Online LLC, or its' affiliates (see Attachment A) (referred to as \"Verizon\", \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\"). This Agreement is comprised of the Service Quotation (\"Quotation\") provided to you, our Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\") set forth at, http://business.verizon.net/policies/acceptable_use.asp, as well as our Privacy Policy located at http://business.verizon.net/policies/privacy.asp and the Privacy Policy located at https://www.homestead.com/~site/Legal/privacy.ffhtml. Your acceptance of the Terms of Service indicates your agreement to comply with this Agreement regarding your use of the Services. You will be deemed to have accepted this Agreement upon the earlier of: (a) submission of your order; (b) acceptance of this Agreement electronically; (c) your use of the Service.\n\nService. The term \"Service\" shall mean the Verizon Websites service, including all features, functions and/or applications that are included with the Verizon Websites service, or are purchased as an additional feature(s) of Verizon Websites, including WebListings. The term \"Content\" shall mean audio, video, image or other files or data in digital or electronic form of any type provided by or on behalf of you that resides on or is linked to or from the Service.\n\nTerm. This Agreement shall be effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement, as provided above, and shall continue either on a month-to-month basis or for the term specified for the Service or Verizon Bundled Service (\"Bundled Service\") plan you select (the \"Initial Term\"). The Initial Term begins when you accept this Agreement and ends when you or we terminate this Agreement as permitted herein. If you subscribe to a plan with a minimum term commitment (a \"Term Plan\"), you agree to maintain the Service or Bundled Service for the duration of that Term Plan. For Verizon Websites, your Term Plan begins on the later of: (a) the date you change your existing Service plan to a Term Plan; or (b) your Service Ready Date; for Bundled Services, your Term Plan begins once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. You will begin receiving any discount associated with a Bundled Service plan once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. At the end of any Term Plan you may be given the option to select a new Term Plan. If you do not select a new Term Plan, your Service will automatically convert to a month-to-month Service plan until terminated by either party as permitted by this Agreement at a monthly fee that may be higher than your current rate. If you select a new Term Plan, the terms of that plan will apply. In the event you change Service or Bundled Service plans, your monthly rate and term commitment may change (depending on the plan you select); otherwise, the terms of this Agreement will remain in effect unless otherwise provided. We reserve the right to terminate the Service (or any part thereof) in the event we cease to offer the Service generally or to your location. If we cease offering the Service (or any part thereof) generally or to your location, we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice.\n\nPrices. We will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice of a price change. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the price change constitutes your acceptance of such change. If you change your Service, you agree to pay the monthly fee that applies to your new Service. You are responsible for all charges associated with the Service, including but not limited to a) applicable taxes, b) surcharges, c) set up fees, and d) charges for FTP site moves, domain name services, and excess storage and resource utilization. These charges may vary on a monthly basis; any variation will be reflected in your monthly bill. You also agree to pay any additional charges or fees applied to your account due to insufficient credit or insufficient funds.\n\nBilling. Billing on your account will begin once your Service order is submitted. We will bill you on a monthly basis using the billing method you select. Any nonrecurring charges for FTP Site moves, domain name services, set-up or other such fees will be included on your first month's bill. Monthly recurring charges will be billed one month in advance; any usage charges will be billed in arrears. Verizon or its agent will bill you directly, or bill your credit card or your local Verizon telephone bill (telephone billing available in selected areas only), as you request and subject to approval by Verizon. IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED FOR THE SERVICE ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT TO HAVE VERIZON CHARGES INCLUDED ON YOUR VERIZON LOCAL TELEPHONE BILL.\n\nPayment, Late Fee and Credit Related Matters. Payment to Verizon is due upon receipt of our invoice and shall be made in U.S. currency. A payment received thirty (30) calendar days or more after the invoice date is considered past due. If your charges are billed by your Verizon local telephone company, the Late Fee applied will be equal to the late payment charge that your local telephone company applies. If your charges are not billed by your Verizon local telephone company, you agree to pay late fees equal to the amount due plus interest of 1.5% for each month or part of a month (or the maximum interest allowed by law, whichever is less). Verizon may assign unpaid delinquent charges to a collection agency for action. If we use a collection agency or take legal action to recover monies due, you agree to reimburse Verizon for all expenses we incur to recover such monies (including attorney's fees). If you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to a credit reporting agency, which will negatively affect your credit report. We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing you Service. In order to establish an account with us and/or obtain or modify Service, we may obtain a report from a consumer credit agency or exchange information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness. Verizon may cancel your order or terminate this Agreement if, in our sole judgment, the results of such credit search are unacceptable.\n\nNo Warranties.

Until now, Danna has only been able to explore digital animation and computer coding at school, in her computer class – but all that is about to change.\n\nToday Danna and each middle-schooler who attends John A. Sutter Middle School in Los Angeles is being issued a free tablet with 24/7 internet access as part of Verizon Innovative Learning. The program will be transformative for Sutter students, in school and beyond.\n\nThis program is about more than just going digital; it’s about leveraging technology to improve classroom instruction and engagement. Verizon Innovative Learning trains teachers to integrate the one-to-one technology in ways that are creative, that add value, and that have been shown to improve student engagement and academic performance. All that preparation was on display on the day of the device rollout, where Sutter students were taking earth science quizzes, Jeopardy-style, in class. Others were learning to create multimedia book reports, or steering sphero balls through the school gym – their engineering teacher offering guidance and encouragement as they did.\n\n“I can feel the energy. I can feel the motivation.”\n\nSince 2012, Verizon has been working to help close the digital divide through a transformative program called Verizon Innovative Learning. The program provides free tech, free internet access and a next-gen, technology-infused curriculum that changes the way teachers teach and students learn.\n\nAnd it’s making a difference by driving real academic improvements: 54% of Verizon Innovative Learning students are more engaged in school and 58% of students were more proficient in STEM.* To date, Verizon has helped more than a million kids get the technology they deserve and is committed to helping 2 million more by 2021.\n\nAs the tablets are distributed to the students, the school’s marching band performs in the courtyard and students giddily show off their new tablets to peers and teachers. Parents and district leaders at Sutter for the event note that palpable excitement. As a local district superintendent, Joseph Nacorda, put it: “I can feel the energy. I can feel the motivation. This is something that’s absolutely important to them.” We spoke with several of the students and administrators about what this day, the new technology and access meant to them.\n\n*Source: Westat (2018). Verizon Innovative Learning Schools – First Analysis of Student Administrative Data From Cohort 3 Schools.\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nPreparing students for high school and beyond.\n\nSixth-grader **Xavier Arce** is a member of Sutter’s new, highly selective tech team, for which interested students must apply and provide teacher recommendations. Those selected help their peers and teachers operate devices and troubleshoot technical issues. It’s a position he relishes, explaining: “I’m really good at tech. It relaxes me, it calms me, and it makes me feel like a teacher.”\n\nLike everyone on the tech team, Xavier got his tablet about a week before the rest of the student body. He immediately sensed it was a big responsibility, but one he was up for. “I feel like they must have trust in me,” he says. “It’s like a baby, you can’t lose it.”\n\nOn the day of the rollout, Xavier, 10, helps other Sutter students set up their devices. He is eager to show them some of his favorite applications, including one that makes math so much fun that he thinks even students who “don’t like math” will be sold.\n\nFor Xavier’s mother, who is selling donuts to support the parent-teacher association during the rollout event, Verizon Innovative Learning is preparing Sutter students for high school, for college and for the workplaces of the future. “That’s where we’re headed,” she says. “Everything is about technology now.”\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nWith expanded access to tech, students are free to extend their education.\n\nEight-grader **Crystal Pacheco** lights up when she discusses the dog wheelchair that her engineering class is developing. They will use their tablets to share sketches and numerical formulas to perfect their final product, which they will create with a 3D printer and a laser cutter.=\n\n“All my projects are team projects,” Crystal’s engineering teacher, **Maria Sklar**, explains. “If half the team doesn’t have WiFi communications, that’s a problem; if the whole team has WiFi communications” – as all students now do, thanks to Verizon Innovative Learning – “they can continue working beyond the school day.”\n\nPrior to the rollout, Crystal – who is in the school’s gifted program and is a leader of its Kind Club, which organizes service projects in and beyond the school community – didn’t have easy access to technology at home. She either had to complete her work in school or wait until the next day. That’s all changed now. “You don’t have to rush to finish your work,” she says. “You can take it home. You can proofread.”\n\nWith technology increasing engagement and giving students the ability to continue working – and finesse their work – beyond the school day, Sutter Principal Kelly Welsh says she expects to see students submit increasingly polished assignments.\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nExcited by the chance to create.\n\nJust as some students are excited to show off the math applications available, **Laura Adlay**, 11, relishes learning how to create a multimedia book report using a storytelling application that her sixth-grade English class is learning hours after receiving their tablets.\n\nIt allows them to take still photographs, and bring them to life through animation. “Some kids don’t know how to draw, and now they don’t need to feel bad about it,” says Laura, an aspiring artist, teacher, and baker.\n\nFor her book report on “The Girl Who Swallowed the Moon,” Laura plans to take a photo of the moon, give the moon eyes and a mouth, and have that moon narrate the synopsis of the book, which imagines the lived experiences of the women of Greek mythology. She says she’s “most excited about being able to take home projects and finish them in my home.”\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nGiving students the freedom to work beyond the classroom.\n\n“This age group has a lot of energy, but they are easily distracted,” Sutter Principal **Kelly Welsh** explains. “Engagement is key.”\n\nInternet-enabled technology goes a long way toward that end, she says – thanks to mathematics and coding applications that Sutter students love, thanks to cameras, recording devices and video-editing software that revolutionize the way children learn, communicate and connect.\n\n“We talk about kids being isolated in technology,” Welsh says, “but if I’m at home and can’t reach out to teachers or classmates, I’m the one who’s isolated if I can’t do that. The kid without a device is locked out of the conversation.”\n\nBefore Verizon Innovative Learning, many Sutter students had limited access, or none at all, to Internet-enabled devices in their homes. As a result, Welsh says, “it was slowing down instruction.” When all students have the ability to get online 24/7, teachers can cover more material in school – assigning additional online reading or video tutorials for homework. It also “builds in remediation and the time and support for individualization,” since students can work independently at their own pace.\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nExploring on their own, “beyond just what’s in the book.”\n\nHer new tablet will allow seventh-grader **Moniq Garcia** to work at her own pace, and to be guided by her own intellectual curiosity. Moniq, who recently moved to the Los Angeles, from Houston, Texas, explained: “We can learn the ins and outs of a subject, not just what they give us.” Even the best textbooks can be limiting because you’re bound by what’s on the page. That’s the benefit of an internet-enabled tablet, the 12-year-old explains, rattling off the names of various educational applications.\n\nBefore Verizon Innovative Learning came to Sutter, Moniq’s only internet access at home was through her phone. Moniq, whose favorite subjects are science and writing, is now able to send herself digital reminders about homework assignments, and she has access to the school’s learning management system and, thus, her classwork wherever she goes. “It’s going to help [with] research beyond just what’s in the book,” Moniq says.\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nHelping ESL students learn English while giving them a voice.\n\n**Hazel Henriquez** eyes the line in the library where the tablets are being issued. It is long, and the seventh-grader fears that by the time she gets to the front, the devices will all be spoken for before she realizes there are enough to go around. As soon as Hazel, 11, receives hers, she uses the device’s camera and editing software, and she begins to “make a scary movie before Halloween.”\n\nHazel arrived in the United States two years ago, from El Salvador, and is an English-language learner. She has no computer at home, and before Verizon Innovative Learning came to Sutter, Hazel and her sister shared a single tablet – making it hard when both had homework assignments that they needed to complete.\n\nShe’s optimistic that having a tablet of her own will make things easier on that front, and also that it will go a long way to boosting her language skills. “I want to learn English this year,” Hazel, an aspiring lawyer, says. “I want to do homework in English.”\n\nSutter teacher **Evelyn Huerta** says technology can make a big difference for students who are learning English as a second language. When they first come to class, many are very timid, and “the teacher doesn’t know if [they’re not participating] because they don’t know the answer or they don’t know a word,” Huerta says. But easy access to translation applications “makes them feel like they have a voice.”\n\n(Photos: Ross Oscar Knight)\n\nWith increased connectivity, “these kids are going to the moon.”\n\n“I’m excited to see Verizon bring connectivity from class to home, from home to class, and from home to the rest of the world,” says **Austin Beutner**, in between engaging students, parents, and teachers on the morning of the rollout.\n\nBeutner is superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second-largest school system. He says he’s gratified that many of the parents in attendance at the event seemed as excited as their children for the opportunities one-to-one technology provides.\n\n“You see this burst of creativity in storytelling. You see students put together a portfolio of their own journey, and it’s more than just words and numbers on a page,” he says. As their access to information expands, it’s pictures, it’s music, it’s more.\n\n“I think these kids are going to the moon,” he says.",

      "content": "# STEM isn’t\n\njust a boy thing.\n\n**Author: Ruth Gallogly**\n\nRuth Gallogly is a content producer and editor for Gyrate Media.\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“I read somewhere that for every one girl that’s in a STEM career, there’s like five boys.”\n\nThis observation came from sixth grader Danielle Amos, looking around the classroom with eyes filled with wonder. “To see that there are 50 girls who want to partake in this is just crazy.”\n\nSeated in the 3D printing lab at the Patrick Henry Community College Thomas P. Dalton IDEA Center, Danielle is busy collaborating with other girls on 3D-printed designs for their upcoming STEM project presentations. Working in small teams, the girls create solutions to issues in their community and present them to their parents and others as the culminating event of this Verizon Innovative Learning three-week STEM immersion experience.\n\nNow in its second summer at Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville, VA, the program is one of 16 around the country focused on getting middle school girls in rural communities excited about careers in STEM. Between summer intensives, the students meet monthly for field trips and to hone their skills.\n\nIt’s all part of the Verizon Innovative Learning mission to provide free technology, free internet access and hands-on learning experiences to help underserved students get the education they deserve. The girls learn 3D printing and vinyl cutting, use littleBits electronic building blocks to master coding techniques, and create augmented and virtual reality experiences they then view through AR and VR goggles. They also build VR goggles out of cardboard to take home. ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nGirl power reigns strong.\n\nIt’s not just STEM skills that the girls get out of the program. The students say they love being in an all-girls environment without boys around who talk about sports, or who take them off task. They feel they learn more this way, but also that they understand and support each other. While watching morning talks from local, professional women, they see it’s cool to be smart and passionate about math and science and to dream big.\n\n“There’s always been a stereotype girl where you’re supposed to shop; you’re not supposed to be in a STEM career,” says Danielle. But thanks to what she is learning with Verizon Innovative Learning, she adds, “I want to break that barrier.”\n\nWe visited the program and spoke with several students who shared their stories of transformation. ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“It doesn’t matter what they say. I know I can do it.”\n\nBefore her time with Verizon Innovative Learning last summer, **Natalie LaPrade** says she doubted herself. Soft-spoken, and with more poise than most 12-year-olds, Natalie has always been interested in being an engineer and an entrepreneur, but in the face of so many people telling her that “STEM was a boy’s thing,” she was losing confidence in her ability to accomplish her dreams. Now, thanks to her time in the program, “It doesn’t matter what they say. I know I can do it.”\n\nWhile Natalie couldn’t attend Verizon Innovative Learning this summer, she was excited to be back for a visit and happily wandered the center’s hallways, stopping in the bustling classrooms of the large, high-ceilinged space to hug and say hi to her friends who were busy programming small electric cars out of littleBits kits and creating virtual reality tours to far off locales filled with crystal clear waters and towering skyscrapers.\n\nBeing in the program has also brought her closer to her mom. For her STEM project last summer, Natalie created a squeezable sensory toy for people with Autism and other diagnoses helped by objects that promote stress reduction, proudly citing a family friend with Down syndrome who uses it to relax.\n\nNatalie wants to continue her business outside of the program and bonds with her mom, a fellow entrepreneur, over developing it -- the two talking often about the rewards and challenges of running a business.\n\n“I think if I didn’t go here, and I didn’t have my experience of building up my self-confidence here,” she says of the program, “I wouldn’t still be doing my own business and helping other people as much as I am.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“I’ve seen tremendous growth in her.”\n\nInstructor **Helen Howel**l said of **Chloe Taylor**, citing how the 12-year-old’s writing and public speaking skills have blossomed and how well Chloe did when presenting in front of approximately 50 people a few weeks prior.\n\nNow in her second summer with Verizon Innovative Learning, Chloe took to heart the advice from one of the morning speakers “to never give up.” “When I get frustrated I want to stop sometimes. To know that I shouldn't give up even though it's tough to keep working through it, that's really helped,” she says.\n\nIt’s important advice for someone who not only wants to go to Harvard and eventually become a neurosurgeon, but whose favorite part of the program is inventing.\n\nSurrounded by the 3D-printed projects that are scattered all over the center—inspiring examples of what the technology can do—she explains her STEM project with a quiet confidence that will serve her well as a surgeon.\n\nHer project: a LED-lit spoon for infants who, due to damage to their ocular nerve, can see only light. The lights help define the spoon so infants know to open their mouths to eat, and there’s also “a little section on the spoon [that] has words to tell the parent either the food is too hot, too cold, or [that] they have too much or too little on the spoon,” Chloe says. As far as she knows, nothing like this spoon exists yet, and it’s projects like this that have made her feel “more confident with my inventions and problem solving.”\n\nAbout the program, she adds, “A really cool thing is being a part of a group of girls that can eventually, or even now, change the world.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“Don’t be afraid to be smart.”\n\nWith a bubbling energy and a wide, winning smile, twelve-year-old **Nayti Patel** thrives on challenges, which is what attracts her to biomedical engineering. She likes that engineering is a field where almost no one gets things right the first time and that you have to be persistent and keep trying.\n\nOne of her recent challenges has been raising her hand in class when no one else has their hand up. “I was like, what if everybody just stares at me and then they'll be calling me ‘smarty pants.’\n\nThey're going to be calling me names,” she says. But after one of the morning speakers told them, “Don’t be afraid to be smart,” and to raise their hands in class, she decided, “I don't care what anybody thinks about me. I know the answer and I want to be better in math and science. So I'm going to say the answer and I'm going to say it proudly.”\n\n“That's what I see her getting from this [program],” instructor Liz Lynch says about Nayti. “She's getting that smart is cool; that smart can bring you places.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“I love building things with new technology.”\n\n**Nadia Flores** seems so at ease speaking but Lynch points out that the 13-year-old used to be shy and terrified of public speaking, in part because English is her second language.\n\nNadia is a leader in her middle school’s robotics club, and the STEM project Nadia and her all-girl team presented at a state championship garnered first place, making this the first time Martinsville has won an award at the state level. Their product, Litmus Lipstick, changes colors to indicate whether or not the person wearing it is well hydrated. Nadia’s team is thinking of patenting it and making a face paint version for boys who play sports like football. Lynch, who is also Nadia’s teacher at school, makes a direct connection between Nadia’s win and her time with Verizon Innovative Learning. “She just had that ‘stick-to-it-iveness’ that I know was fostered from this program.\n\nI really think [Verizon Innovative Learning] was a springboard for thinking scientifically.”\n\nNadia wanted to be a doctor before learning how many years she’d have to spend in school, she admits sheepishly; now she wants to be an engineer. “I love building things with new technology,” something she figured out through robotics and being in the program this year. It also helped her improve in math. She puffs with pride as she shares that she went from scoring 80s on tests to now scoring 99s, and that she skipped math 7 this past year to go straight from math 6 to algebra.\n\nOn public speaking she says, “I’m always nervous speaking in front of other people,” admitting she was “freaking out” when presenting the lipstick to the judges at states. But, she adds, “I’m getting used to it now that this program is helping me.” ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“I can see a world of difference.”\n\n**Helen Howell**, a native of Virginia and the head of the local chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, has dedicated a large part of her career to educating and mentoring kids from Martinsville and surrounding communities into pursuing STEM careers and encouraging them to pay it forward when they succeed. In her second summer working with Verizon Innovative Learning, Howell notes how girls from the area are starting to win STEM competitions around Virginia, like the first place at states Nadia Flores’ team earned.\n\n“What I'm seeing from this is they are taking these [competitions] a lot more seriously,’” she says. “With the students that were in the [program], I can see a world of difference. They're more confident and stepping up to the plate and taking on leadership positions.”\n\nHowell credits these wins to the way Verizon Innovative Learning is igniting STEM in the community and teaching girls the skills they need to succeed. ♦\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\n“Oh, that’s a boy’s job. You can’t do that.”\n\nPetite with a charming cuteness about her, it’s easy to see how someone could underestimate how strong and determined **Danielle Amos **has become. Before starting Verizon Innovative Learning last summer, she thought she’d work in an office somewhere simply to earn enough money to live. But that all changed when the program taught her there were jobs she could do that harnessed her fascination with space.\n\n“I never thought that I could be a NASA engineer because that just seemed way too crazy. I’ve always been told, ‘Oh, that’s a boy’s job. You can’t do that.’” Now, she says, “Stuff like that makes me want to do it more so I can prove to people that say that that girls can actually do things that boys can.”\n\nBeing in the program has helped her better understand big picture science concepts.\n\nShe’s connecting the dots on a deeper level, she says, and while she’s always been an A student, her test scores this past year increased from 90s to 100s. Doing things like 3D printing, which she describes as “really crazy to see your ideas come to life,” has improved her math skills too.\n\nShe lights up as she points to the cones and cylinders that are the building blocks of Tinkercad, a 3D design program, sharing how measuring their radius and diameter has increased her understanding of how these concepts play out in the actual creation of objects.\n\nThe confidence and skills she’s gained haven’t only been career changing for her, they’ve been life changing. Before the program, she says, “I wanted to change the world in some way, but I wouldn’t have known how to do it. The [program] showed me that no matter where you came from or what your problems are, you can do anything in this world.” ♦",

CONFIAMOS EN QUE ESTARÁ SATISFECHO CON NUESTROS SERVICIOS, PERO SI EXISTE ALGÚN PROBLEMA QUE PRECISA SER RESUELTO, EN ESTA SECCIÓN SE EXPLICAN LAS EXPECTATIVAS MUTUAS AL RESPECTO. USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDAN RESOLVER DISPUTAS SOLO POR ARBITRAJE O EN UN TRIBUNAL DE DEMANDAS DE MENOR CUANTÍA. EL ARBITRAJE NO INCLUYE LA PARTICIPACIÓN DE UN JUEZ O UN JURADO, Y LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS PUEDEN DIFERIR, PERO UN ÁRBITRO PUEDE CONCEDER LOS MISMOS DAÑOS Y EL MISMO RESARCIMIENTO Y DEBE ACEPTAR LOS MISMOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTE ACUERDO COMO LO HARÍA UN TRIBUNAL. SI LA LEY PERMITE LA CONCESIÓN DE HONORARIOS DE ABOGADO, UN ÁRBITRO TAMBIÉN PUEDE DECRETARLOS. ASIMISMO, AMBAS PARTES ACORDAMOS QUE:\n\na. EL FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (LA LEY FEDERAL DE ARBITRAJE) SE APLICA A ESTE ACUERDO. EXCEPTO LOS CASOS QUE CALIFIQUEN PARA SU PRESENTACIÓN EN UN TRIBUNAL COMPETENTE PARA DEMANDAS DE MENOR CUANTÍA, TODA DISPUTA QUE SURJA EN RELACIÓN CON EL PRESENTE ACUERDO O CON LOS EQUIPOS, PRODUCTOS Y SERVICIOS QUE LE PRESTEMOS (O DE CUALQUIER PUBLICIDAD DE CUALQUIER PRODUCTO O SERVICIO) SERÁ RESUELTA POR UNO O MÁS ÁRBITROS IMPARCIALES ANTE LA AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\"). ASIMISMO, USTED PUEDE PRESENTAR EN EL BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU (\"BBB\"), A CONSIDERACIÓN DE LAS AGENCIAS GUBERNAMENTALES FEDERALES, ESTATALES O LOCALES CUALQUIER ASUNTO QUE USTED PUEDA TENER Y ESTAS AGENCIAS PUEDEN, SI LA LEY LO PERMITE, RECLAMARNOS EL RESARCIMIENTO EN SU NOMBRE.\n\nb. A MENOS QUE USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDEN LO CONTRARIO, EL ARBITRAJE TENDRÁ LUGAR EN EL CONDADO DE SU DIRECCIÓN DE SERVICIO. PARA RECLAMACIONES MAYORES A $10,000, SE APLICARÁN LAS NORMAS DE ARBITRAJE DE LA AAA; EN TALES CASOS, EL PERDEDOR PUEDE APELAR A UN ÓRGANO COLEGIADO DE TRES NUEVOS ÁRBITROS PARA QUE REVISE LA DECISIÓN. PARA RECLAMACIONES DE $10,000 O DE MENOS CUANTÍA, LA PARTE DEMANDANTE PUEDE ELEGIR LAS NORMAS DE ARBITRAJE DE LA AAA PARA ARBITRAJE VINCULANTE, O BIEN PUEDE ENTABLAR UNA DEMANDA INDIVIDUAL EN UN TRIBUNAL COMPETENTE PARA DEMANDAS DE MENOR CUANTÍA . USTED PUEDE OBTENER INFORMACIÓN SOBRE PROCEDIMIENTOS, NORMAS Y CARGOS DE LA AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG) O A TRAVÉS DE NOSOTROS. EN RECLAMACIONES DE $10,000 O DE MENOR CUANTÍA, USTED PUEDE ELEGIR SI DESEA QUE EL ARBITRAJE SE REALICE SOLO EN BASE A DOCUMENTOS ENVIADOS AL ÁRBITRO, O MEDIANTE UNA AUDIENCIA EN PERSONA O POR TELÉFONO.\n\nc. ESTE ACUERDO NO PERMITE ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS, INCLUSO SI SON PERMITIDOS POR LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS O REGLAS DE LA AAA. INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER OTRA DISPOSICIÓN DE ESTE ACUERDO, EL ÁRBITRO NO TENDRÁ AUTORIDAD PARA DETERMINAR SI ES PERMISIBLE EL ARBITRAJE COLECTIVO. EL ÁRBITRO TAMPOCO TENDRÁ AUTORIDAD PARA PRESIDIR ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS NI PARA OTORGAR NINGÚN TIPO DE RECURSO COLECTIVO. EN CAMBIO, EL ÁRBITRO PUEDE DECRETAR UN RESARCIMIENTO MONETARIO O CONMINATORIO SOLO EN FAVOR DE LA PARTE INDIVIDUAL QUE RECLAME EL RESARCIMIENTO Y SOLO EN LA MEDIDA NECESARIA PARA OFRECER EL RESARCIMIENTO GARANTIZADO POR LA RECLAMACIÓN INDIVIDUAL DE DICHA PARTE. NO PODRÁN APLICARSE TEORÍAS DE RESPONSABILIDAD NI SOLICITUDES DE COMPENSACIÓN COLECTIVAS O REPRESENTATIVAS O CON UN APODERADO GENERAL EN NINGÚN ARBITRAJE REALIZADO CONFORME A ESTE ACUERDO. NO SE APLICARÁ NINGUNA REGLA DE LA AAA QUE CONTRADIGA LAS DISPOSICIONES DE ESTE . ADEMÁS, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER DISPOSICIÓN CONTRARIA A LAS REGLAS DE LA AAA O EL BBB, EL ÁRBITRO QUEDARÁ OBLIGADO A APLICAR PRINCIPIOS LEGALES Y LAS LEYES QUE RIGEN EL PRESENTE ACUERDO, Y NO TIENE AUTORIDAD PARA OTORGAR NINGUNA COMPENSACIÓN QUE NO ESTÉ AUTORIZADA POR DICHAS LEYES.\n\nd. SI CUALQUIERA DE NOSOTROS DESEA SOLICITAR ARBITRAJE EN VIRTUD DE ESTE ACUERDO, LA PARTE QUE DESEE EL ARBITRAJE PRIMERO DEBE NOTIFICAR A LA OTRA PARTE DE LA DISPUTA POR ESCRITO CON AL MENOS 30 DÍAS DE ANTICIPACIÓN ANTES DE COMENZAR EL ARBITRAJE. SE DEBE NOTIFICAR A VERIZON A NOTICEOFDISPUTE@VERIZON.COM O A VERIZON DISPUTE RESOLUTION MANGER , ONE VERIZON WAY, VC54N090, BASKING RIDGE, NJ 07920. LA NOTIFICACIÓN DEBE DESCRIBIR LA NATURALEZA DEL RECLAMO Y EL RESARCIMIENTO DESEADO. SI NO PODEMOS RESOLVER LA DISPUTA DENTRO DE LOS 30 DÍAS, CUALQUIERA DE LAS PARTES PUEDE PRESENTAR UN RECLAMO DE ARBITRAJE. VERIZON PAGARÁ CUALQUIER CARGO DE INTERPOSICIÓN QUE LA AAA LE COBRE POR EL ARBITRAJE DE LA DISPUTA. SI NOS BRINDA UNA NOTIFICACIÓN POR ESCRITO FIRMADA EN LA QUE INDIQUE QUE NO PUEDE PAGAR EL CARGO DE INTERPOSICIÓN, VERIZON PAGARÁ EL CARGO DIRECTAMENTE A LA AAA. SI PROCEDE ESE ARBITRAJE, TAMBIÉN PAGAREMOS CUALQUIER CARGO ADMINISTRATIVO ADICIONAL Y LOS HONORARIOS DEL ÁRBITRO QUE SE COBREN CON POSTERIORIDAD, ASÍ COMO (SI EL LAUDO ARBITRAL ES APELABLE EN VIRTUD DE ESTE ACUERDO) LOS CORRESPONDIENTES A CUALQUIER APELACIÓN ANTE UN ÓRGANO COLEGIADO DE TRES NUEVOS ÁRBITROS.\n\ne. PODEMOS OFRECER UNA OFERTA ESCRITA DE CONVENIO EN CUALQUIER MOMENTO ANTES DEL COMIENZO DEL ARBITRAJE, PERO NO ESTAMOS OBLIGADOS A HACERLO (O, SI NO HAY UNA AUDIENCIA PROBATORIA, ANTES DE QUE LAS PARTES COMPLETEN LA PRESENTACIÓN DE SUS PRUEBAS AL ÁRBITRO). EL IMPORTE O LAS CONDICIONES DE LA OFERTA DE CONVENIO NO PUEDEN SER REVELADAS AL ÁRBITRO HASTA DESPUÉS DE QUE EL ÁRBITRO HAYA OTORGADO UN LAUDO A LA RECLAMACIÓN. SI USTED NO ACEPTA ESTA OFERTA Y EL ÁRBITRO LE OTORGA UNA SUMA DE DINERO QUE ES SUPERIOR A LA OFERTA PERO INFERIOR A $5000, O SI NO LE HACEMOS UNA OFERTA, Y EL ÁRBITRO LE OTORGA CUALQUIER SUMA DE DINERO INFERIOR A $5000, ENTONCES ACEPTAMOS PAGARLE $5000 EN LUGAR DE LA SUMA OTORGADA. EN ESE CASO, TAMBIÉN ACEPTAMOS PAGAR HONORARIOS DE ABOGADOS RAZONABLES Y GASTOS, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE LO QUE LA LEY DISPONGA PARA SU CASO. SI EL ÁRBITRO LE OTORGA UNA SUMA SUPERIOR A $5000, LE PAGAREMOS DICHA SUMA.\n\nf. EL LAUDO ARBITRAL Y CUALQUIER CONFIRMACIÓN JUDICIAL SOLO SE APLICAN A ESE CASO ESPECÍFICO Y NO SE PUEDEN UTILIZAR EN NINGÚN OTRO CASO, EXCEPTO PARA HACER CUMPLIR DICHO LAUDO ARBITRAL.\n\ng. SI POR CUALQUIER MOTIVO NO SE PUEDE CUMPLIR LA PROHIBICIÓN DE LOS ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS ESTABLECIDA EN LA SUBSECCIÓN 16(c), ESTE ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE NO SERÁ VÁLIDO.\n\nh. SI POR CUALQUIER MOTIVO PROCEDE UNA RECLAMACIÓN EN JUICIO A DILUCIDAR ANTE UN TRIBUNAL EN VEZ DE POR ARBITRAJE, USTED Y VERIZON ACEPTAN QUE NO TENGA LUGAR UN JUICIO CON JURADO. USTED Y VERIZON RENUNCIAN INCONDICIONALMENTE A CUALQUIER DERECHO A JUICIO POR JURADO EN CUALQUIER ACCIÓN, PROCEDIMIENTO O RECONVENCIÓN QUE SURJA DE O SE RELACIONE CON ESTE ACUERDO DE CUALQUIER FORMA. EN CASO DE LITIGIO, PUEDE PRESENTARSE ESTE PÁRRAFO PARA DEMOSTRAR CONSENTIMIENTO POR ESCRITO A UN JUICIO POR TRIBUNAL.\n\nv.17-1 Fios Prepaid\n\nEffective Date: September 12, 2017",

      "content": "#### 1. 머리말\n\n이 정책의 목적은 미국 이외 국가에 위치한 Verizon 기업(이 정책에서는 통칭해서 “Verizon”, \"당사\", \"당사의\" 또는 \"당사에게\"라 함)이 개인 데이터를 수집 및 이용하는 방법을 설명하기 위한 것입니다. Verizon은 전 세계의 개인 정보 보호법에 따라 개인 데이터의 수집에 해당되는 일정한 정보를 제공해야 합니다. 이 일반 정책 외에도 귀하가 당사와 상호 작용하는 방식에 따라 귀하는 개인 데이터 사용 방법에 대한 추가 정보를 받아볼 수 있습니다.\n\n#### 2. Verizon가 수집하는 개인 데이터의 종류는 무엇입니까?\n\nVerizon은 고객과 그 직원, 신청자, 최종 사용자, 공급자, 웹 사이트 방문자, 애플리케이션 사용자 및 입사 지원자에게서 개인 데이터를 수집합니다. 수집된 개인 데이터에 포함될 수 있는 내용은 다음과 같습니다. 이름, 주소, 전화 번호(유선 및/또는 휴대전화), 이메일 주소, 회사 또는 고용주 이름, 개인 연락 이름 및 직위, 팩스 번호, IP 주소, 장치 식별 및 위치 정보, 서비스 및 사이트 사용 정보, 청구서 발행 및 거래 정보, 신용카드 또는 기타 금융 정보. 예를 들어 주문 또는 홍보되는 서비스에 따라 수집하는 정보의 특성은 달라집니다. 텔레매틱스 서비스를 이용하는 고객에게서는 위치 및 속도를 비롯한 차량 및 주행 정보를 수집합니다.\n\n#### 3. Verizon은 개인 데이터를 어떻게 수집합니까?\n\nVerizon은 고객 및 최종 사용자의 (전화, 팩스 또는 이메일, 인터넷 또는 신청서, 주문서 또는 계약서를 통한) 주문서를 비롯해 기존 고객 및 잠재 고객이 제공하는 제품 및 서비스, 포털 및 앱, 여러 가지 조사, 공급업체, 계약자 또는 신청자를 통한 여러 가지 방법으로 개인 데이터를 획득할 수 있습니다.\n\nVerizon은 \"쿠키\" 및 유사한 기술을 사용해 웹 사이트에 대한 방문 또는 이메일에 대한 응답에 대한 정보를 획득할 수 있습니다. 쿠키는 컴퓨터의 메모리와 하드 드라이브 또는 모바일 장치에 저장되는 작은 텍스트 파일입니다. 쿠키는 당사 사이트가 작동할 수 있도록 하는 데 사용되나 타사에 정보를 제공할 수 있습니다. 이 정보는 사용자, 사용자 기본 설정 또는 장치에 대한 정보일 수 있습니다. 이 정보는 사용자를 직접 식별할 수는 없지만 보다 개인화된 환경을 제공할 수 있습니다. 특히 쿠키는 (a) 당사 사이트의 품질과 유용성을 개선하고 귀하가 관심이 있는 웹 사이트나 이메일 부분을 결정하고, (b) 귀하의 기술 선호 사항(구성과 사용자 특성의 저장 및 인식 포함)을 식별하며, (c) 탐색을 용이하게 하고, (d) 사용자 환경을 개인화하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 쿠키를 사용하면 웹 사이트의 비밀번호로 보호되는 부분에 자동으로 입력할 수 있으며, 따라서 사용자는 웹 사이트를 방문할 때마다 비밀번호를 다시 입력할 필요가 없습니다.\n\n다음은 당사에서 사용하는 쿠키 유형 및 이와 관련된 옵션 목록입니다.\n\n필수 쿠키는 귀하가 요청한 서비스를 제공할 수 있게 해주며 웹 사이트와 해당 기능을 안전하게 유지시켜 줍니다. 이러한 쿠키를 사용하지 않도록 설정하면 웹 사이트의 기능에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 귀하는 필수 쿠키를 선택하지 않을 수도 있습니다.\n\n사용 기본 설정 쿠키는 당사 사이트에서 특정 항목을 선택하고 비밀번호와 설정 기본 설정을 기억할 때 활성화되므로 당사가 제공하는 환경을 사용자에 맞게 조정할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 이러한 쿠키에 대한 동의를 옵트인하고 취소할 수 있습니다.\n\n분석 쿠키를 사용하면 당사는 귀하의 사이트 사용을 인식 및 측정하고, 이 사용 정보에 대한 기록을 편집하며, 당사 사이트의 작동 방식을 개선하고 개발할 수 있습니다. 당사의 사이트에서는 Google Analytics 쿠키를 사용하여 사용자가 당사 사이트를 어떻게 사용하는지 분석합니다. 쿠키에 의해 생성된 정보는 일반적으로 미국의 Google서버에 저장됩니다. 그러나 EU 또는 유럽 경제 지역 내에 위치한 경우 사전에 Google에서 IP주소를 단축합니다. 예외적인 경우에만, 귀하의 전체 주소가 미국의 Google 서버로 전송되고 이곳에서 단축될 것입니다. Verizon을 대신하여, Google은 웹 사이트 활동에 대한 보고서를 수집하기 위해 이 정보를 사용할 것입니다. Google Analytics의 일부로 브라우저에서 전송된 IP 주소는 Google이 보유한 다른 데이터와 연결되지 않습니다. 브라우저 플러그인을 다운로드하고 설치하는 경우 웹 사용 데이터가 Google로 전송되지 않도록 할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 이러한 쿠키에 대한 동의를 옵트인하고 취소할 수 있습니다.\n\n당사와 제3자가 게시한 행동 기반 맞춤형 광고 쿠키를 통해 특정 사이트에서 사용자의 행동을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 이 정보는 (a) 특정 웹 사이트의 광고나 타사 웹 사이트의 광고를 통해 맞춤형 경험을 제공하거나 (b) 디지털 마케팅 캠페인의 효과를 모니터링하는 데 사용됩니다. 귀하는 광고 쿠키에 대한 동의를 옵트인하고 취소할 수 있습니다. 당사는 온라인 행동 기반 맞춤형 광고를 위한 유럽 인터랙티브 디지털 광고 연합과 영국 인터넷 광고국의 우수한 관행을 준수해야 하는 서약을 포함한 광고 파트너를 이용합니다. 인터넷 광고국에서 행동 기반 맞춤형 광고에 대해 자세히 알아보고 옵트아웃할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n목적에 따라 일부 쿠키는 단일 검색 세션 동안만 작동하는 반면 다른 쿠키는 원하는 기능을 수행하기 위해 더 오랜 시간 동안 작동합니다. 인터넷 브라우저를 통해 쿠키를 삭제 또는 차단하거나 다른 상업용 소프트웨어를 통해 쿠키를 차단할 수 있지만 웹 사이트의 일부 기능을 이용하지 못할 수 있으며, 이러한 제어 기능은 일부 기술에서 작동하지 않을 수 있습니다.\n\n귀하에게 보내는 이메일은 이메일을 열거나 이메일의 링크를 클릭하는 사람 수를 판단하는 데 사용하는 웹 비콘을 포함할 수 있습니다. 수신하는 이메일을 통한 웹 비콘을 허용하지 않고 싶은 경우에는 HTML 이미지를 비활성화하거나 이메일 소프트웨어 내에서 HTML(텍스트만 선택)을 거부할 수 있습니다.\n\n컨퍼런스, 회의 및 세미나에서 수집하는 사용자에 대한 정보를 획득할 수 있습니다. 또한 채팅실, 블로그 포스트, 뉴스 그룹 및 소셜 네트워크 사이트를 통해 수집할 수도 있습니다. 소셜 네트워크 사이트에서 접속할 수 있는 사용자 정보는 사이트에 따라 다르며, 각 사이트에 설정하는 개인 정보 보호 설정에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다.\n\nVerizon은 또한 제3자에게서 데이터를 수집합니다. 예를 들어 Verizon은 제3자에게서 고객 및 최종 사용자에게 관한 금융 정보를 수집하여 지불 조건을 부여할 때의 위험도를 평가할 수 있으며, 또한 제품 및 서비스에 관심이 있는 조직에 관한 연락처 정보를 구매할 수 있습니다.\n\n#### 4. Verizon은 수집하는 개인 데이터를 어떻게 이용합니까?\n\nVerizon은 서비스 제공, 계정, 청구, 기술 지원, 제품 개발 및 지불 신청 등의 활성화를 포함하여 다양한 용도로 개인 데이터를 사용합니다. 텔레매틱스 고객이 경우에는 Verizon이 차량 및 주행 정보를 개인 데이터에 링크할 수 있습니다. 또한 Verizon은 개인 데이터를 이용하여 고객에게 제공하는 서비스를 개선하고 사기 및 기타 불법 행위에 대처할 수 있습니다.\n\nVerizon은 또한 개인 데이터를 이용하여 조사 요청을 포함해 제품 및 서비스에 관해 사용자에게 연락합니다. Verizon은 해당 데이터 보호 또는 개인 정보 보호법 또한 사용자가 명시하는 우선권에 부합하는 경우 마케팅 또는 특정 서비스와 무관한 다른 목적에 개인 데이터를 사용합니다.\n\nVerizon 웹 사이트 및 앱을 이용하면, (처음 방문하는지 또는 반복적인 방문자의 여부를 포함해) 웹 사이트에 방문한 날짜, 횟수 및 방문 시간, 웹 사이트 및 앱과 상호 작용하는 브라우징, 검색 및 구매 활동, IP 주소, 휴대전화 번호, 사용자가 웹 사이트에 접속한 사이트의 웹 주소, 사용자 장치의 브라우저, 운영 시스템 및 플랫폼 유형을 포함해 연결에 대한 정보 등을 포함해 장치와 방문에 대한 정보가 수집됩니다. 이러한 정보는 운영, 성능 측정 및 기타 사업상의 목적에 사용되며, 사용자, 비Verizon 웹 사이트에 대한 보다 많은 관련 Verizon 마케팅 메시지를 전달하는 데 도움을 받기 위해 사용됩니다. 마케팅 메시지는 당사의 대리점에서 이메일이나 다른 Verizon 서비스 또는 장치를 통해 전달될 수 있습니다. 이러한 정보는 또한 사용자가 확인하는 내용을 맞추는 데 사용되며, 사이트의 효과를 평가하고 사이트를 탐색할 때 발생하는 문제에 대한 사용자의 도움 요청을 지원하는데 사용될 수도 있습니다.\n\n또한 의뢰 서비스를 이용하여 웹 사이트에 있는 페이지에 대해 친구에게 말해 주려고 하는 경우에는 친구에게 직접 이메일을 보내야 합니다. 다만 친구에게 허락을 받은 경우에만 그 방법을 사용하십시오. 친구가 직접 사용자에 대해 조회하는 경우에는 관련 법률에 따라 특정 지역에서 사용자에게 마케팅할 수 있도록 제공된 연락처 정보를 사용할 수 있습니다. 일부 지역에서는 또한 관련 법률에서 허용하는 범위 내에서 품질 관리, 교육 또는 보안을 위해 사용자가 당사와 나누는 전화 대화를 모니터하거나 기록할 수 있습니다.\n\n당사는 Verizon이 귀하 또는 회사에 제공하는 특정 서비스를 기반으로 귀하의 개인 데이터를 사용하는 방법에 대한 구체적인 정보를 관련 법률에 따라 제공할 것입니다.\n\n일부 국가의 현지 법률에 따라 당사는 귀하의 개인 데이터를 처리하기 위해 당사가 이용하는 법적 근거를 설명할 수 있어야 합니다. 대부분의 경우, 당사는 계약의 목적을 위해 필요하거나 당사가 법적 의무를 이행할 필요가 있을 때와 같이 합법적인 비즈니스 이익(예: 서비스가 어떻게 사용되는지 이해할 수 있고 새로운 서비스를 개발할 수 있는 지식을 얻을 수 있는 경우)을 위해 귀하의 개인 데이터를 처리할 것입니다. 당사는 합법적인 비즈니스 이익을 위해 귀하의 개인 데이터를 처리할 때 귀하의 개인 정보가 보호되고 귀하의 이익이나 기본적인 권리와 자유에 의해 당사의 정당한 이익이 침해되지 않도록 합니다.\n\n특정 상황(예: 일부 마케팅 활동과 관련하여) 및 법률에서 요구하는 경우 당사는 귀하의 개인 정보 처리에 대한 동의를 요청할 수 있으며, 귀하는 본 통지가 끝난 후 당사에 연락하여 언제든지 동의를 철회할 수 있습니다.\n\n#### 5. Verizon은 언제 개인 데이터를 공유합니까?\n\nVerizon은 본 개인 정보 보호 정책 및 특정 서비스에 대한 개인 정보 알림에 설명된 대로, 고객과의 계약서에 기술된 대로, 귀하의 동의에 따라, 기타 관련 법적 근거가 있는 경우 Verizon 계열사의 범위를 벗어나서 개인 데이터를 공유합니다.\n\n당사는 Verizon 계열의 다른 비즈니스 및 회사와 긴밀하게 협력하고 있으며, 내부 보고, 마케팅, 고객 통찰력 및 서비스 최적화 등의 목적으로 사용자의 개인 데이터를 이들과 공유할 수 있습니다.\n\nVerizon은 다양한 사업상의 목적에 공급업체 및 협력사를 이용하여 제공하는 서비스의 제안, 제공, 수리, 복구 및 청구하고 있습니다. 또한 당사를 대신하여 업무를 수행하는 데 필요한 경우 그러한 공급업체 및 협력사와 개인 데이터를 공유합니다. 다만 이러한 공급업체 및 협력사에게 개인 데이터를 보호하고 개인 데이터의 사용을 제공된 목적으로 제한하도록 요구하고 있습니다. 또한 이런 공급업체와 협력사가 자체 마케팅 목적에 이러한 정보를 사용하는 것을 허용하지 않습니다.\n\nVerizon은 또한 다음과 같은 경우에 개인 데이터를 공유할 수 있습니다. (i) 법률 또는 규제 의무에 따라 공개해야 하는 경우, (ii) 고객 부채(또는 당사 고객이나 다른 사람의 부채 사용)을 수입하는 데 필요한 절차의 일부인 경우를 포함해 공공 안전을 위험하게 하거나 Verizon 재산 또는 서비스를 방해할 수 있는 사람에 대한 식별, 연락 또는 법적 조치를 취해야 하는 경우 또는 (iii) 모든 자산 또는 자산의 일부에 대한 판매나 양도 제안 또는 실제 판매나 양도와 관련된 경우. 그런 공개는 반드시 관련 법률에 따라서 이루어집니다.\n\n웹 사이트 또는 서비스의 일부를 Verizon 및 협력사가 공동으로 제공할 수 있습니다. 해당 웹 사이트 또는 서비스에 등록하거나 사용하는 경우, Verizon과 다른 회사는 개인 데이터를 수신할 수 있습니다. 이와 같이 서비스가 공동으로 제공되는 경우에는 여기에 규정된 관행과 다른 관행이 포함되어 있을 수 있는 협력사의 개인 정보 정책을 검토해야 합니다.\n\nVerizon 웹 사이트 및 서비스에는 플러그인 또는 위젯을 클릭하거나 상호 작용하지 않더라도 사용자가 방문하는 페이지나 사용하는 서비스와의 상호 작용에 대한 정보를 제공할 수 있는 소셜 네트워크나 타사 플러그인 및 위젯을 포함할 수 있습니다.\n\n일본의 Verizon Enterprise Solutions 고객의 경우, Verizon은 다음과 같은 방법으로 계열사와 개인 데이터를 공동으로 사용합니다. Verizon Japan Ltd는 이 개인 정보 보호 정책의 2절에 정의된 개인 데이터를 Verizon Business Network Services Inc.와 공동으로 사용하게 되며, Verizon Enterprise Solutions가 사업을 수행하는 국가에 있는 Verizon 기업은 이 개인 정보 보호 정책의 3절에 정의된 방법으로 4절에 기술된 목적을 위해 사업을 수행합니다.\n\n#### 6. Verizon은 개인 데이터를 국제적으로 양도합니까?\n\n사용자에게 서비스를 제공하는 Verizon 기업은 전 세계의 Verizon 계열사의 일원으로서 법률에 따라 개인 데이터를 Verizon 계열사의 다른 구성원 또는 제3자 협력사 및 공급업체에게 양도할 수 있습니다. 개인 데이터를 수신하는 기업은 최초에 개인 데이터를 공유했던 목적에 대해서만 사용할 수 있으며 추가로 다른 용도에 사용하지 못하도록 보호해야 합니다. 이런 기업들은 사용자의 거주 국가 이외의 지역에 있을 수 있습니다. 이런 기업들이 항상 사용자의 서비스 국가와 동일한 데이터 보호 또는 개인 정보 보호법을 갖추고 있지 않거나 국가의 개인 정보 보호 요구 사항에 대해 \"적절한\" 또는 그러한 요구 사항과 \"동등한\" 보호를 제공하지 않은 것으로 생각될 수 있지만, 사용자 서비스를 제공하는 Verizon 법인은 전 세계의 직원과 제3자 제공자에게 사용자에게 약속하는 동일하게 높은 수준의 개인 정보 보호 기준을 적용합니다. Verizon은 일부 Verizon 그룹사 내에 개인 정보 전송을 위한 구속력 있는 기업 규칙(\"BCR\")을 채택했으며 다른 전송에 대한 계약 보호를 마련했습니다. BCR은 이곳에서 볼 수 있습니다. www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. 또한 전송은 귀하의 동의에 따라 이루어질 수 있으며, 이 동의는 적절한 시기에 얻을 것입니다.\n\n#### 7. Verizon은 수집하는 개인 데이터를 어떻게 보호합니까?\n\nVerizon은 고객 비밀 유지 및 보안을 중요하게 생각합니다. Verizon은 기술, 관리 및 물리적 보호 장치를 갖추고 사회 보장 번호를 포함해 당사에서 수집 또는 저장하는 고객 정보에 대한 무단 접속하거나 고객 정보를 무단으로 사용 또는 공개하지 않도록 보호합니다. 직원은 개인 정보 보호의 중요성 및 고객 정보에 대한 적절한 접속 또는 고객 정보의 사용이나 공개에 대한 교육을 받습니다. 개인 정보 보호 관행 및 정책에 따라, 개인적으로 식별할 수 있는 민감한 정보에 대한 액세스는 사업상 그러한 정보에 접속해야 하는 사람에게만 허가됩니다. 개인 데이터 또는 다른 민감한 기록은 사업, 회계, 세금 또는 다른 법적 목적을 위해 합리적으로 필요한 기간에만 보관되며, 개인 정보를 보관하도록 요구하는 대한민국의 국세기본법 같은 관련 법률을 준수합니다.\n\n당사에서 수집 및 저장하는 개인 정보를 보호하기 위해 노력하지만 100% 안전한 프로그램은 어디에도 없으며, 당사는 당사의 안전 보장 장치가 무단으로 개인 정보에 접속하거나 개인 정보를 사용 또는 공개하려고 하는 모든 시도를 막는다고 보장할 수 없습니다. Verizon은 보안 및 사고 대응 계획을 수립해 수집 또는 저장하는 개인 정보에 대한 모든 접속을 포함한 사고를 처리하고 있습니다.\n\n#### 8. 데이터 보호 권리\n\n관련 법률에 따라 사용자는 개인 데이터를 접속, 업데이트, 수정, 교정 및 합리적으로 가능한 경우에는 삭제하도록 요구하거나 개인 데이터의 사용에 대한 동의를 철회할 수 있습니다. 당사에 이메일을 보내거나 아래의 회사 연락처 세부 사항을 통해 당사에 연락하여 귀하의 권리를 행사할 수 있습니다. 하지만 일정한 유형의 개인 정보에 대한 동의를 철회하거나 정보를 삭제하기로 하는 경우에는 당사가 고객, 공급업체 또는 협력사로서 특정 서비스를 제공하지 못하거나 사용자가 입사 지원자 또는 계약자로서 제공하는 질문에 응답하지 못할 수 있습니다. 당사에서는 사용자 및 사용자의 정보를 보다 적절하게 보호하기 위해 정보에 대한 접속을 허가하고 정보를 변경하기 전에 신원을 확인하는 조치를 취하고 있습니다.\n\nEEA에 거주하는 경우 개인 정보 보호를 담당하는 지방 당국에게 불만 사항을 제출할 권리가 있으며 다른 국가에서도 이 권리를 가질 수 있습니다.\n\n#### 9. 연락처 세부 사항\n\n이 정책 및 사용자 데이터 보호권에 관한 질문인 경우에는 이메일을 통해 직접 질문을 보내거나 데이터 보호 책임자에게 다음 주소로 서신을 보내십시오.\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nRIBP Floor 1 Spur D Basingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nUnited Kingdom RG26DA\n\n#### 10. 정책 업데이트\n\n당사는 이 개인 정보 보호 정책을 변경할 수 있으며, 따라서 주기적으로 변경 여부를 확인하십시오. 이 정책의 끝 부분에 게시된 발효일을 확인하여 변경이 이루어졌는지 여부를 확인할 수 있습니다. Verizon이 사용자에게서 해당 정보를 수집할 때 이 정책에 기술된 것과 크게 다른 방식으로 개인 데이터를 사용 또는 공개하기로 하는 경우에는 탈퇴 장치의 사용을 포함해 그러한 사용 또는 공개와 관련하여 선택할 수 있는 권한을 선택권을 적절한 방법으로 사용자에게 제공합니다.\n\n**2018년 5월 24일**",

      "content": "#### 1. Introduction\n\nL'objectif de cette politique est d'expliquer comment les sociétés Verizon établies hors des États-Unis (désignées collectivement dans cette politique sous le terme « Verizon », « nous », « notre » ou « nos ») collectent et utilisent vos données à caractère personnel. Les lois sur la protection des renseignements personnels partout dans le monde exigent que Verizon vous fournisse certaines informations applicables à la collecte de vos données personnelles. En plus de cette politique générale, vous pouvez recevoir des informations supplémentaires sur la façon dont nous utilisons vos données personnelles en fonction de la façon dont vous interagissez avec nous.\n\n#### 2. Quels types de données personnelles Verizon recueille-t-elle ?\n\nVerizon recueille des données personnelles auprès des clients et de ses employés, candidats, utilisateurs finaux, fournisseurs, visiteurs du site, utilisateurs d'applications et candidats à un poste.

La nature des informations que nous recueillons dépendra, par exemple, des services commandés ou proposés. Pour les clients qui utilisent nos services télématiques, nous collectons également des informations sur les véhicules et la conduite, y compris des informations telles que la localisation et la vitesse.\n\n#### 3. Comment Verizon obtient-elle des données personnelles ?\n\nVerizon peut obtenir des données personnelles de diverses façons, notamment à partir de commandes passées par des clients et des utilisateurs finaux, (que ce soit par téléphone, fax ou e-mail, Internet ou par le biais d'un formulaire de demande, d'un bon de commande ou d'un contrat), de produits et de services, de portails et d'applications, de demandes de renseignements formulées par des clients actuels et des clients potentiels, ainsi qu'auprès de fournisseurs, de sous-traitants ou de candidats à un emploi.\n\nVerizon peut utiliser des « cookies » et des technologies similaires pour obtenir des informations sur les visites sur nos sites ou vos réponses à nos e-mails.

Nous utiliserons vos données personnelles à des fins de marketing ou à d'autres fins non liées à votre service spécifique lorsque cela est conforme à la législation applicable en matière de protection des données ou de confidentialité et aux préférences que vous exprimez.\n\nLorsque vous utilisez les sites Web et applications Verizon, des informations sont collectées concernant votre appareil et votre visite, notamment les dates, heures et durées des visites sur nos sites (qu'il s'agisse d'une première visite ou de visites régulières) ; les activités de navigation, de recherche et d'achat lorsque vous interagissez avec nos sites et applications ; l'adresse IP ; le numéro de téléphone mobile ; les adresses Web des sites d'où vous venez et où vous allez ensuite, notamment si vous avez visité le site Web directement ou si vous avez été redirigé depuis un autre site Web ou un autre lien ; les informations de localisation correspondant aux paramètres de votre navigateur et votre choix d'application et des informations sur votre connexion, incluant le navigateur, le système d'exploitation et le type de plate-forme de votre appareil. Nous utilisons ces informations à des fins opérationnelles, de mesure des performances et à d'autres fins commerciales, et pour nous aider à diffuser des messages marketing Verizon plus pertinents sur nos sites Web, sur des sites Web non-Verizon. Les messages marketing peuvent être transmis par nos représentants, par courrier électronique ou par d'autres services ou dispositifs Verizon. Ces informations sont également utilisées pour personnaliser le contenu que vous voyez et peuvent également être utilisées pour évaluer l'efficacité de nos sites et pour vous aider à obtenir de l'aide en cas de problèmes de navigation sur nos sites.\n\nSi vous choisissez d'utiliser notre service de référence pour informer un ami d'une page sur l'un de nos sites Web, il vous sera demandé d'envoyer un e-mail directement à votre ami. Veuillez le faire seulement si vous avez la permission de votre ami. Si vos amis vous réfèrent directement à nous, nous pouvons, dans certaines zones géographiques, utiliser les informations de contact fournies pour commercialiser nos offres à votre attention, conformément à la loi applicable. Dans certains de nos emplacements géographiques, et dans la mesure permise par la loi applicable, nous pouvons surveiller ou enregistrer vos conversations téléphoniques avec nous à des fins de contrôle de la qualité, de formation et de sécurité.\n\nNous fournirons les informations spécifiques requises par les lois en vigueur sur la façon dont nous utilisons vos données personnelles en fonction du service particulier que Verizon fournit à vous ou à votre entreprise.\n\nEn vertu des lois locales de certains pays, nous devons être en mesure de décrire la base juridique sur laquelle nous nous appuyons pour traiter vos données personnelles. Dans la plupart des cas, nous traiterons vos données personnelles pour nos intérêts commerciaux légitimes (par exemple, pour nous permettre de comprendre comment nos services sont utilisés et pour obtenir des connaissances nous permettant de développer de nouveaux services), lorsque cela est nécessaire aux fins d'un contrat, ou lorsqu'il nous est nécessaire de le faire pour satisfaire à nos obligations légales. Lorsque nous traitons vos données personnelles dans le cadre de nos intérêts commerciaux légitimes, nous mettons en place des mesures de protection pour garantir la protection de votre vie privée et pour nous assurer que vos intérêts ou vos droits et libertés fondamentaux ne priment pas sur nos intérêts légitimes.\n\nDans certains cas (par exemple, en relation avec certaines de nos activités marketing) et lorsque la loi l'exige, nous pouvons vous demander votre consentement pour traiter vos données personnelles, et vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment en nous contactant en utilisant les détails à la fin de cet avis.\n\n#### 5. Quand Verizon partage-t-elle des données personnelles?\n\nVerizon partage des données personnelles en dehors de la famille de sociétés Verizon, comme décrit dans la présente Politique de confidentialité et dans les avis de confidentialité pour des services spécifiques, comme indiqué dans les accords avec nos clients, avec votre consentement, et dans les autres cas où nous avons une base légale pour le faire en vertu de la loi applicable.\n\nNous travaillons en étroite collaboration avec d'autres entreprises et sociétés de la famille Verizon, et nous pouvons partager vos données personnelles avec elles à des fins telles que le reporting interne, le marketing, la connaissance des clients et l'optimisation des services.\n\nVerizon fait appel à des fournisseurs et à des partenaires pour diverses raisons commerciales, notamment pour nous aider à offrir, fournir, réparer, restaurer et facturer les services que nous fournissons. Nous partageons des données personnelles avec ces fournisseurs et partenaires lorsqu'il est nécessaire pour eux d'effectuer des travaux en notre nom. Nous exigeons de ces fournisseurs et partenaires qu'ils protègent les données personnelles que nous leur fournissons et qu'ils limitent leur utilisation des données personnelles aux fins pour lesquelles elles ont été fournies. Nous ne permettons pas à ces fournisseurs et partenaires d'utiliser ces informations à des fins de marketing.\n\nVerizon peut également partager des données personnelles (i) lorsque la loi ou l'obligation réglementaire l'y oblige ou le permet ; (ii) lorsque cela est nécessaire pour identifier, contacter ou intenter une action en justice contre des personnes qui pourraient mettre en danger la sécurité publique ou interférer avec des biens ou des services de Verizon - y compris dans le cadre de toute procédure nécessaire pour recouvrer une dette client - ou l'utilisation de ceux-ci par nos clients ou d'autres personnes ; ou (iii) dans le cadre de toute vente proposée ou réelle ou tout autre transfert d'une partie ou de la totalité de nos actifs. Ces informations ne sont divulguées que conformément aux lois applicables.\n\nCertains de nos sites Web ou services peuvent être offerts conjointement par Verizon et l'un de nos partenaires. Si vous vous abonnez à ces sites Web ou services ou si vous les utilisez, Verizon et l'autre société peuvent recevoir des données personnelles. Pour ces services offerts conjointement, vous devrez également examiner la politique de confidentialité de l'entreprise partenaire, qui peut inclure des pratiques différentes de celles décrites ici.\n\nLes sites Web et services de Verizon peuvent inclure des plugs-ins et des widgets de réseaux sociaux ou de tiers qui peuvent fournir des informations à leurs réseaux sociaux associés ou à des tiers sur vos interactions avec les pages de Verizon que vous visitez ou les services que vous utilisez, même si vous ne cliquez pas sur le plug-in ou le widget ou si vous n'interagissez pas avec le plug-in ou le widget.\n\nPour les clients de Verizon Enterprise Solutions au Japon, Verizon utilisera conjointement les données personnelles avec sa famille d'entreprises de la manière suivante. Verizon Japan Ltd utilisera conjointement les données personnelles de la façon définie à l'article 2 de la présente Politique de confidentialité avec Verizon Business Network Services Inc. et les sociétés Verizon situées dans les pays où Verizon Enterprise Solutions mène des activités commerciales aux fins énoncées à l'article 4 de la présente Politique de confidentialité par les moyens identifiés à l'article 3 de la présente Politique de confidentialité.\n\n#### 6. Verizon transfère-t-elle des données personnelles à l'étranger?\n\nEn tant que membre de la famille d'entreprises Verizon dans le monde entier, la société Verizon qui vous fournit des services peut, conformément à la loi, transférer vos données personnelles à d'autres membres de la famille d'entreprises Verizon ou à des partenaires et fournisseurs tiers. Les entités qui reçoivent vos données personnelles ne peuvent les utiliser qu'aux fins pour lesquelles elles ont été partagées à l'origine, et elles doivent les protéger de toute utilisation ultérieure. Ces sociétés peuvent être situées en dehors du pays où vous être situé. Bien que ces pays ne disposent pas toujours des mêmes lois sur la protection des données ou de la confidentialité que votre pays ou qu'ils ne soient pas toujours censés fournir des protections « adéquates » ou « équivalentes » aux exigences de confidentialité de votre pays de service, l'entité Verizon qui fournit votre service lie ses employés internationaux et ses fournisseurs tiers au même niveau élevé de protection des informations personnelles que celui auquel elle s'est engagée envers vous. Verizon a adopté des règles d'entreprise contraignantes (Binding Corporate Rules (« BCR ») pour les transferts de renseignements personnels au sein de certaines sociétés du groupe Verizon et a mis en place des protections contractuelles pour d'autres transferts. Les BCR sont disponibles ici : www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. De plus, les transferts peuvent être fondés sur votre consentement, que nous obtiendrons au moment opportun.\n\n#### 7. Comment Verizon protège-t-elle les données personnelles qu'elle recueille ?\n\nVerizon prend très au sérieux la confidentialité et la sécurité de ses clients. Verizon a mis en place des mesures de protection techniques, administratives et physiques pour aider à se protéger contre l'accès, l'utilisation ou la divulgation non autorisés des informations concernant les clients que nous recueillons ou stockons, dont les numéros de sécurité sociale. Les employés reçoivent une formation sur l'importance de la protection des renseignements personnels et sur l'accès, l'utilisation et la divulgation appropriés des renseignements sur les clients. En vertu de nos pratiques et politiques, l'accès à des informations sensibles identifiables personnellement est autorisé uniquement pour ceux qui ont besoin d'y accéder à des fins commerciales. Les données personnelles et autres documents sensibles sont conservés aussi longtemps que raisonnablement nécessaire à des fins commerciales, comptables, fiscales ou juridiques, et nous respectons les lois applicables telles que la loi fiscale nationale en Corée du Sud (National Tax Basic Act) qui exigent que nous conservions les données personnelles.\n\nBien que nous nous efforcions de protéger les renseignements personnels que nous recueillons et stockons, aucun programme n'est entièrement sécurisé et nous ne pouvons garantir que nos mesures de protection empêcheront toute tentative non autorisée d'accéder, d'utiliser ou de divulguer des renseignements personnels. Verizon maintient des plans de sécurité et d'intervention en cas d'incident pour traiter les incidents impliquant un accès non autorisé aux informations privées que nous recueillons ou stockons.\n\n#### 8. Droits de protection des données\n\nSous réserve des lois applicables, vous pouvez demander l'accès, la mise à jour, la rectification, le transfert, la rectification et, lorsque cela est raisonnablement possible, la suppression de vos données personnelles, ou retirer votre consentement à l'utilisation de vos données personnelles. Vous pouvez exercer vos droits en nous envoyant un e-mail ou en nous contactant via les coordonnées de la société ci-dessous. Veuillez noter toutefois que le retrait du consentement ou la suppression de certains types de renseignements personnels peut nous empêcher de vous fournir certains services en tant que client, fournisseur ou partenaire, ou de répondre à vos questions en tant que postulant à un poste ou sous-traitant. Afin de mieux vous protéger et de protéger vos informations, nous prenons des mesures pour vérifier votre identité avant d'accorder l'accès ou d'apporter des modifications à vos informations.\n\nSi vous êtes dans l'EEE, vous avez le droit de déposer une plainte auprès de votre autorité locale responsable de la protection de la vie privée, et vous pouvez également disposer de ce droit dans d'autres pays.\n\n#### 9. Coordonnées\n\nPour toute question concernant cette politique ou vos droits en matière de protection des données, veuillez nous adresser directement votre question par e-mail ou par écrit à l'attention de notre délégué à la protection des données à l'adresse suivante :\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nRIBP Floor 1 Spur D Basingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nUnited Kingdom RG26DA\n\n#### 10. Mises à jour de la Politique\n\nNous nous réservons le droit d'apporter des modifications à cette politique de confidentialité, veuillez donc vérifier périodiquement les modifications. Vous pourrez constater que des modifications ont été apportées en vérifiant la date d'entrée en vigueur affichée à la fin de la politique. Si Verizon choisit d'utiliser ou de divulguer vos données personnelles d'une manière substantiellement différente de celle indiquée dans notre politique au moment où nous avons collecté ces informations auprès de vous, nous vous donnerons le choix quant à cette utilisation ou divulgation par des moyens appropriés, qui peuvent inclure le recours à un mécanisme de retrait.\n\nConsulter les modifications récentes apportées à la politique de confidentialité\n\n**24 mai 2018**",

General Policy:** Verizon reserves the sole discretion to deny or restrict your Service, or immediately to suspend or terminate your Service, and pass on any directly resulting consequences if the use of your Service by you or anyone using it, in our sole discretion, violates the Agreement or other Verizon or industry policies, is objectionable or unlawful, interferes with the functioning or use of the Internet or the Verizon network or Services by Verizon or other users, or violates the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”).\n\n**2. Specific Examples of AUP Violations. **The following are examples of conduct which may lead to termination of your Service. Without limiting the general policy in Section 1, it is a violation of the Agreement and this AUP to: (a) access without permission or right the accounts or computer systems of others, to spoof the URL, DNS or IP addresses of Verizon or any other entity, or to penetrate the security measures of Verizon or any other person’s computer system, or to attempt any of the foregoing; (b) transmit uninvited communications, data or information, or engage in other similar activities, including without limitation, “spamming”, “flaming” or denial of service attacks; (c) intercept, interfere with or redirect email or other transmissions sent by or to others; (d) introduce viruses, worms, harmful code or Trojan horses on the Internet or the Verizon network; (e) post off-topic information on message boards, chat rooms or social networking sites; (f) engage in conduct that is defamatory, fraudulent, obscene or deceptive; (g) violate Verizon’s or any third party’s copyright, trademark, proprietary or other intellectual property rights; (h) engage in any conduct harmful to the Verizon network, the Internet generally or other users; (i) generate excessive amounts of email or other Internet traffic; (j) use the Service to violate any rule, policy or guideline of Verizon or relevant industry sector; (k) use the Service in any fashion for the transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography or in a manner that is obscene, sexually explicit, cruel or racist in nature or which espouses, promotes or incites bigotry, hatred or racism; or (l) download or use the Service in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria or to destinations that are otherwise controlled or embargoed under U.S. law, as modified from time to time by the Departments of Treasury and Commerce.\n\n**3. Third Party Intellectual Property Infringement. **Verizon respects the intellectual property rights of third parties. Accordingly, you may not store any material or use Verizon's systems or servers in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including, for example, under copyright law. Pursuant to Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, it is Verizon’s policy to terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers in appropriate circumstances. In addition, Verizon expressly reserves the right to suspend, terminate or take other interim action regarding the Service of any user or account holder if Verizon, in its sole judgment, believes that circumstances relating to an infringement of third party intellectual property rights warrant such action. These policies are in addition to and do not affect or modify any other rights Verizon may have under law or contract.\n\n**4. **Verizon may, but is not required to, monitor your compliance, or the compliance of other users, with the terms, conditions or policies of this Agreement and AUP. You acknowledge that Verizon shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pre-screen, refuse, move or remove any content available on the Service, including but not limited to content that violates the law or this Agreement.\n\n**Updated on August 2024**",

PRECIOS Y PAGO.**\n\nComo contraprestación de su recepción del Servicio y el uso de los Equipos u Otros Dispositivos, usted acepta pagarnos lo siguiente:\n\n(a) Cargos por el Servicio. La facturación del Servicio comenzará automáticamente: (i) Una vez instalado el Servicio si el Servicio es instalado por Verizon o (ii) en la fecha de vencimiento establecida por Verizon (luego de que se haya entregado el Equipo u Otros Dispositivos aplicables) en caso de que usted mismo haya instalado el Servicio. La facturación continuará hasta que el Servicio sea cancelado de conformidad con la Sección 10 (a) de este Acuerdo.. Una vez que hayan sido instalados todos los Servicios combinados, comenzará a recibir los descuentos asociados con un plan de Servicios combinados. Los cargos comunes por el Servicio y los Equipos (y, si corresponde, Otros Dispositivos) se facturan todos los meses de manera anticipada. Usted acepta pagarnos de manera anticipada, con la tarifa vigente en ese momento, durante todos los períodos hasta que finalice el Servicio de conformidad con la Sección 10 (a) de este Acuerdo. Otros cargos por transacciones, como para los servicios de On Demand o Pay Per View, se facturan luego de que usted haya pedido o recibido el servicio o la función correspondiente. También puede tener la obligación, sobre la base de su historial de pedidos y pagos, de realizar pagos antes de la facturación con tarjeta de crédito u otros métodos de pago que podamos designar para los servicios transaccionales tales como los servicios de On Demand o Pay Per View. Usted acepta pagar todos los cargos correspondientes para el Servicio y los Equipos u Otros Dispositivos antes de la fecha de vencimiento que se indica en la factura mensual. Nosotros podemos modificar las tarifas del Servicio y otros cargos en cualquier momento (excluidos los cargos detallados en las secciones 11(b) – (d)), mediante la provisión de aviso previo según lo establezcan las leyes correspondientes. Si le enviamos un aviso, se lo enviaremos según se establece en la Sección 14 a continuación. Las tarifas de los servicios de On Demand o Pay Per View pueden cambiar en cualquier momento. Su facturación también puede contener otros cargos (incluidos, sin limitación, impuestos y otras tarifas gubernamentales y cargos como tarifas de franquicias, cargos por activación e instalación de la cuenta, costos relacionados con las franquicias, recargos, tarifas de reactivación, tarifas de configuración personalizada, cargos por pagos atrasados sobre saldos adeudados, cargos por pagos devueltos, cargos por cancelación prematura y otros cargos no recurrentes) y usted acepta pagar estos otros cargos antes de la fecha de vencimiento indicada en la facturación. La exención de tarifas o cargos queda a nuestro criterio. Si cancela algún servicio del Plan de servicios combinados, los cargos mensuales de los servicios restantes en su cuenta se facturarán automáticamente con la tarifa de servicio mensual sin descuento aplicable al momento en que cancele el servicio.\n\n(b) Planes de tarifas con plazos mínimos. Si se suscribe a un plan de servicios combinados con un contrato por plazo, acepta mantener dichos servicios durante el plazo mínimo del plan. Al finalizar el plazo, es posible que tenga la posibilidad de elegir un nuevo plan de servicios combinados. Si no elige un nuevo plan de servicios combinados, su cuenta se convertirá automáticamente en un plan de servicio mensual con un cargo mensual que puede ser superior al de su tarifa actual. Si se suscribe a un nuevo plan de servicios combinados, se aplicarán los plazos de ese plan.\n\n(c) Cargos de terceros. Usted reconoce y acepta que puede incurrir en cargos con terceros que son distintos y aparte de los Cargos por el servicio que nosotros cobramos. Esto puede incluir cargos ocasionados por el acceso a los servicios en línea o la compra de productos y servicios mediante opciones interactivas disponibles a través del Servicio y puede incluir cargos o tarifas por servicios o datos adicionales de un proveedor de servicios inalámbricos o de Internet (que puede ser un tercero o una afiliada de Verizon).

También es el único responsable de proteger la seguridad de la información de la tarjeta de crédito y otra información personal que se proporciona a terceros en relación con dichas transacciones.\n\n(d) Cargos por pago atrasado. Si nosotros no recibimos el pago total y completo en la fecha de vencimiento, podemos cobrarle un cargo por pago atrasado sobre el saldo impago y también podemos dar por finalizado o suspender el Servicio. Si tenemos que recurrir a una agencia de cobro o inicia acciones legales para recuperar el saldo impago, usted acepta reembolsarnos todos los gastos incurridos para la recuperación de dicho saldo impago, incluidos honorarios y costas razonables de abogados. Si no paga a tiempo y Verizon remite su(s) cuenta(s) a terceros a fin de cobrarla(s), se aplicará un cargo por cobro que vencerá al momento de la derivación de la(s) cuenta(s) al tercero. El cargo se calculará al porcentaje máximo permitido por las leyes correspondientes que no excederá el 18 por ciento.\n\n(e) Depósito del cliente. Podemos solicitarle que proporcione un depósito reembolsable (“Depósito del cliente”) antes de la activación o reactivación del Servicio o luego de hacerlo. También podemos solicitar un Depósito del cliente adicional después de la activación del Servicio si usted no paga un importe a su vencimiento de acuerdo con el presente documento o si pretende actualizar su Servicio. Aplicamos Depósitos del cliente contra los importes no pagados en cualquier momento. Dentro de los noventa (90) días de la finalización del Servicio, nosotros devolveremos una suma equivalente al Depósito del cliente, sin intereses, excepto que las leyes lo exijan, menos los importes vencidos y pendientes de pago de su cuenta, incluidos, entre otros, los importes adeudados por equipos no devueltos o dañados.\n\n(f) Preguntas sobre la facturación.

Salvo que las leyes correspondientes permitan lo contrario, usted acepta que pagará las facturas con cheque, tarjeta de crédito o débito, pagos por transferencia electrónica de fondos u otros métodos de pago que podamos designar.

Usted acepta no asignar ni transferir de otro modo este Acuerdo ni los derechos u obligaciones que establece, en su totalidad ni en forma parcial, a ninguna otra persona. Cualquier intento de hacerlo será nulo. También acepta notificarnos sobre los cambios en la propiedad o la ocupación de la Vivienda de inmediato una vez que se realice dicha transferencia de propiedad o cambio en la ocupación. Podemos asignar libremente la totalidad o parte de este Acuerdo con o sin previo aviso y usted acuerda realizar todos los pagos subsiguientes según se indique.\n\n(c) Leyes aplicables. Excepto que la ley exija lo contrario, usted y Verizon aceptan que la Ley Federal de Arbitraje y las leyes sustantivas del estado y el área local en que se encuentra su Vivienda (la “Jurisdicción del Servicio”), sin referencia a sus principios de conflictos con las leyes, serán aplicadas para regir, interpretar y poner en práctica todos los derechos y las obligaciones de las partes que surjan del tema principal de este Acuerdo o estén de alguna manera relacionadas con él. A MENOS QUE USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDEN LO CONTRARIO, USTED Y VERIZON ACEPTAN LA JURISDICCIÓN PERSONAL EXCLUSIVA Y LA COMPETENCIA JURISDICCIONAL DE UN TRIBUNAL DE DEMANDAS DE MENOR CUANTÍA UBICADO EN LA JURISDICCIÓN DEL SERVICIO PARA CUALQUIER JUICIO O DEMANDA JUDICIAL RELACIONADOS DE CUALQUIER MANERA, DIRECTA O INDIRECTAMENTE, CON EL TEMA PRINCIPAL DE ESTE ACUERDO.

Este programa es totalmente voluntario y no afecta de ninguna manera los derechos de ambas partes en cualquier otro aspecto de los procedimientos de resolución de disputas descritos en la sección 17. A través de nuestro programa de mediación voluntaria, asignaremos un empleado que no tenga relación directa con la disputa para que ayude a ambas partes a llegar a un acuerdo. Esa persona tiene todos los derechos y protecciones de un mediador y el proceso tiene todas las protecciones de una mediación.

ACCIONES DE ARBITRAJE O RECLAMACIONES DE MENOR CUANTÍA.**\n\nConfiamos en que estará satisfecho con nuestros servicios, pero si existe algún problema que precisa ser resuelto, en esta sección se explican las expectativas mutuas al respecto. USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDAN RESOLVER DISPUTAS SOLO POR ARBITRAJE O EN UN TRIBUNAL DE DEMANDAS DE MENOR CUANTÍA. EL ARBITRAJE NO INCLUYE LA PARTICIPACIÓN DE UN JUEZ O UN JURADO, Y LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS PUEDEN DIFERIR, PERO UN ÁRBITRO PUEDE CONCEDER LOS MISMOS DAÑOS Y EL MISMO RESARCIMIENTO Y DEBE ACEPTAR LOS MISMOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTE ACUERDO COMO LO HARÍA UN TRIBUNAL. SI LA LEY PERMITE LA CONCESIÓN DE HONORARIOS DE ABOGADO, UN ÁRBITRO TAMBIÉN PUEDE DECRETARLOS. ASIMISMO, AMBAS PARTES ACORDAMOS QUE:\n\n(a) La Ley Federal De Arbitraje se aplica a este Acuerdo. Excepto los casos que califiquen para su presentación en un tribunal competente para demandas de menor cuantía, toda disputa que surja en relación con el presente Acuerdo o con los equipos, productos y servicios que le prestemos (o de cualquier publicidad de cualquier producto o servicio) será resuelta por uno o más árbitros imparciales ante la American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Asimismo, usted puede presentar en el Better Business Bureau (“BBB”), a consideración de las agencias gubernamentales federales, estatales o locales, cualquier asunto que usted pueda tener y estas agencias pueden, si la ley lo permite, reclamarnos el resarcimiento en su nombre.\n\n(b) A MENOS QUE USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDEN LO CONTRARIO, EL ARBITRAJE TENDRÁ LUGAR EN EL CONDADO DE LA JURISDICCIÓN DEL SERVICIO. Para reclamaciones mayores a $10,000, se aplicarán las normas de arbitraje de la AAA; en tales casos, el perdedor puede apelar a un órgano colegiado de tres nuevos árbitros para que revise la decisión. En reclamaciones de $10,000 o de inferior cuantía, la parte demandante puede elegir las normas de la AAA, o bien puede entablar una demanda individual en un tribunal competente para demandas de menor cuantía. Usted puede solicitar información sobre procedimientos, normas y cargos a la AAA (www.adr.org) o a nosotros. En reclamaciones de $10,000 o de menos cuantía, usted puede elegir si desea que el arbitraje se realice solo en base a documentos enviados al árbitro, o mediante una audiencia en persona o por teléfono.\n\n(c) ESTE ACUERDO NO PERMITE ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS, INCLUSO SI SON PERMITIDOS POR LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS O REGLAS DE LA AAA. INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER OTRA DISPOSICIÓN DE ESTE ACUERDO, EL ÁRBITRO NO TENDRÁ AUTORIDAD PARA DETERMINAR SI ES PERMISIBLE EL ARBITRAJE COLECTIVO. EL ÁRBITRO TAMPOCO TENDRÁ AUTORIDAD PARA PRESIDIR ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS NI PARA OTORGAR NINGÚN TIPO DE RECURSO COLECTIVO. EN CAMBIO, EL ÁRBITRO PUEDE DECRETAR UN RESARCIMIENTO MONETARIO O CONMINATORIO SOLO EN FAVOR DE LA PARTE INDIVIDUAL QUE RECLAME EL RESARCIMIENTO Y SOLO EN LA MEDIDA NECESARIA PARA OFRECER EL RESARCIMIENTO GARANTIZADO POR LA RECLAMACIÓN INDIVIDUAL DE DICHA PARTE.

      "content": "# Avoiding Potential Hearing Loss\n\nMisusing any portable audio device, including mobile phones, can impact your hearing and potentially lead to hearing loss.\n\nProlonged exposure to loud sounds is the most common cause of preventable hearing loss. Some scientific research suggests using portable audio devices, like portable music players and wireless phones, at high volume settings for long durations may lead to permanent hearing impairments. These impairments may include noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus (a ringing in the ear), hypersensitivity to sound and distorted hearing. Individual susceptibility can happen regardless of headphone use.\n\nWe encourage you to follow these common-sense recommendations when using any portable audio device:\n\n- Set your device’s volume in a quiet environment and select the lowest volume at which you can adequately hear.\n- Don’t turn the volume up to block out noisy surroundings. If you choose to listen to your portable device in a noisy environment, use noise-canceling headphones to block out background environmental noise.\n- When using headphones, if you can’t hear people speaking near you or if someone sitting next to you can hear what you’re listening to, it’s too loud. Turn the volume down.\n- Limit your listening time. As the volume increases, less time is required before your hearing could be affected.\n- Avoid using headphones after exposure to extremely loud noises such as concerts that might cause temporary hearing loss. Temporary hearing loss might cause unsafe volumes to sound normal.\n- Do not listen at any volume that causes you discomfort. If you experience ringing in your ears, hear muffled speech or experience any temporary hearing difficulty after listening to your portable audio device, discontinue use and consult your doctor.\n\nLearn more from the American Academy of Audiology\n\nLearn more from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health",

      "content": "#### 1. Введение\n\nВ этом документе объясняется, как перечисленные ниже компании Verizon за пределами США (далее совместно именуемые Verizon, «мы», «наш», «нам») собирают и используют персональные данные пользователей. В соответствии с законами о конфиденциальности, действующими в различных странах, компания Verizon обязана предоставлять сведения о сборе персональных данных своих пользователей. Помимо информации в этой общей политике вы можете получить дополнительные сведения о том, как мы используем ваши персональные данные в зависимости от вашего взаимодействия со службами Verizon.\n\n#### 2. Какие персональные данные собирает Verizon?\n\nVerizon собирает персональные данные клиентов и их сотрудников, заявителей, конечных пользователей, поставщиков, посетителей веб-сайтов, пользователей приложений и соискателей вакансий. К собираемым данным могут относиться: имя, адрес, номер телефона (стационарного или мобильного), адрес эл. почты, название вашей компании или имя работодателя, имена контактов и названия их должностей, номера факсов, IP-адреса, идентификаторы устройств и данные о местоположении, информация об использовании служб и сайтов, информация о выставлении счетов и транзакциях, сведения о кредитных картах и другая финансовая информация. Информация, которую мы собираем, зависит, помимо прочего, от заказываемых или рекламируемых услуг. Если клиенты используют услуги телематики Verizon, компания также собирает информацию о транспортных средствах и их перемещениях, в том числе о местоположении и скорости.\n\n#### 3. Как Verizon получает персональные данные?\n\nVerizon может получать персональные данные разными способами, в том числе при оформлении заказов клиентами и конечными пользователями (по телефону, факсу, эл. почте, через Интернет, с помощью формы заявки, формы заказа или контракта), с помощью продуктов и услуг, порталов и приложений, информационных запросов от существующих и потенциальных клиентов, а также от поставщиков, подрядчиков и соискателей.\n\nVerizon может использовать файлы cookie и другие подобные технологии, чтобы получать информацию о посещении сайтов компании или об ответах на рассылаемые компанией эл. письма. Файлы cookie — это небольшие текстовые файлы, которые сохраняются в памяти и на жестком диске вашего компьютера или мобильного устройства. Файлы cookie необходимы для работы наших сайтов и могут передавать информацию третьим сторонам. Эта информация может включать сведения о вас, ваших предпочтениях или о вашем устройстве. Данная информация не позволяет напрямую идентифицировать вашу личность, но может помочь нам предоставить вам наиболее подходящие услуги. В частности, файлы cookie: (a) помогают нам повышать качество обслуживания и эффективность сайтов и узнавать, какие страницы веб-сайтов или электронные письма вам интересны; (б) определять ваши предпочтения в области технологий, в том числе сохранять и распознавать конфигурацию вашего устройства и пользовательские атрибуты; (в) улучшать навигацию по сайтам; (г) предоставлять вам только необходимую информацию. Файлы cookie также позволяют автоматизировать вход в разделы веб-сайтов, защищенные паролем, чтобы пользователям не нужно было вводить пароль при каждом посещении.\n\nДалее перечислены типы файлов cookie, которые мы используем. Здесь вы можете согласиться с их использованием или отказаться от них.\n\nОбязательные файлы cookie позволяют нам предоставлять вам требуемые услуги. С их помощью мы обеспечиваем безопасность сайта и его функций. Отключение этих файлов cookie может нарушить работу сайта. Отключить обязательные файлы cookie нельзя.\n\nФайлы cookie, связанные с предпочтениями пользователя, включаются, когда вы задаете на наших сайтах определенные настройки, и сохраняют их. Также в них хранятся ваши пароли. С ними использование сайта будет максимально удобным. От использования этих файлов cookie можно отказаться.\n\nФайлы cookie, связанные со средствами аналитики, дают нам возможность распознавать вас как пользователя наших сайтов и собирать статистические данные о вашем взаимодействии с ними. Мы изучаем эти данные за различные периоды времени, чтобы с их помощью улучшать работу сайтов. Наши сайты используют файлы cookie Google Analytics, которые помогают нам анализировать действия посетителей. Данные, получаемые с помощью такого файла cookie, обычно сохраняются на серверах Google, расположенных в США. Однако если вы проживаете в странах ЕС или Европейской экономической зоны, перед сохранением Google сократит ваш IP-адрес. Лишь в исключительных случаях ваш IP-адрес может быть передан на сервер Google в США в полном виде и затем сокращен. Google будет использовать эту информацию в интересах Verizon для составления отчетов о взаимодействии пользователей с нашими сайтами. IP-адрес, переданный из вашего браузера как часть данных Google Analytics, не будет связан с какими-либо иными данными, имеющимися в распоряжении Google. Чтобы предотвратить передачу данных об использовании веб-сайтов в Google, требуется загрузить и установить специальный плагин для браузера. От использования этих файлов cookie можно отказаться.\n\nФайлы cookie для поведенческой рекламы, которые размещает Verizon и сторонние поставщики, позволяют отслеживать ваше поведение на некоторых сайтах. Полученные данные используются: (a) чтобы предлагать вам рекламу на наших и сторонних сайтах в соответствии с вашими интересами или (б) для мониторинга эффективности наших цифровых маркетинговых кампаний. От использования файлов cookie, связанных с рекламой, можно отказаться. Наши рекламные партнеры, в том числе Oath, обязаны придерживаться Принципов добросовестной практики в области поведенческой рекламы в Интернете, принятых Европейским альянсом интерактивной цифровой рекламы (EDAA) и Бюро интернет-рекламы Великобритании. Получить дополнительную информацию и отказаться от поведенческой рекламы можно на сайте Бюро интернет-рекламы.\n\n\nВ зависимости от своего назначения некоторые файлы cookie работают лишь на протяжении отдельного интернет-сеанса, другие — дольше. Пользователи могут удалить или запретить файлы cookie в своем веб-браузере или другом коммерческом программном продукте. Однако в этом случае они не смогут получить доступ к некоторым функциям сайтов Verizon. Эти возможности управления действуют не для всех технологий.\n\nЭлектронные письма Verizon могут содержать веб-маяки, которые позволяют нам определить, сколько человек открыли письма или перешли по ссылкам в них. Чтобы запретить веб-маяки во входящих электронных письмах, можно отключить HTML-изображения или запретить HTML (выбрав вариант «Только текст») в почтовом приложении.\n\nVerizon может также собирать информацию об участниках конференций, встреч и семинаров компании. Verizon также может собирать информацию в комнатах чатов, из записей в блогах, новостных групп и социальных сетей. Информация в социальных сетях, к которой Verizon разрешен доступ, зависит от настроек сайта социальной сети, в том числе от заданных вами настроек конфиденциальности.\n\nVerizon также получает данные от третьих сторон. Например, Verizon может получать финансовую информацию о клиентах и конечных пользователях от третьих сторон, чтобы оценить риски в случае предоставления кредитов. Verizon также может покупать контактные данные организаций, которые могут быть заинтересованы в продуктах и услугах компании.\n\n#### 4. Как Verizon использует собранные персональные данные?\n\nVerizon использует ваши персональные данные для различных целей, к которым относится предоставление услуг, регистрация учетной записи, выставление счетов, техническая поддержка, разработка продуктов и платежи. Если клиенты используют услуги телематики, Verizon может привязывать информацию о транспортных средствах и перемещениях к их персональным данным. Кроме того, Verizon использует персональные данные для улучшения услуг, которые компания предлагает клиентам, и для борьбы с мошенничеством или другими незаконными действиями.\n\nПомимо этого, мы можем использовать персональные данные для связи с вами по поводу продуктов и услуг, в том числе с предложением принять участие в опросе. Мы используем ваши персональные данные для маркетинговых и других действий безотносительно услуги, используемой вами, если это согласуется с действующим законом о защите данных или конфиденциальности и с вашими пожеланиями.\n\nПри использовании веб-сайтов и приложений Verizon компания собирает информацию о вашем устройстве, посещениях сайтов (дата, время, длительность посещения, первое или повторное посещение и т. д.), переходах между страницами, поисковых запросах и покупках на сайтах и в приложениях Verizon, а также IP-адрес, номер мобильного телефона, веб-адреса сайтов (с какого сайта пришел и на какой перешел пользователь, было ли это целевое посещение сайта Verizon или переход с другого сайта или по ссылке), местоположение с учетом настроек браузера и выбора приложения, сведения о подключении, включая браузер, операционную систему и платформу устройства. Verizon использует эту информацию для осуществления операций, оценки эффективности и в других целях, важных для бизнеса. Эти сведения также помогают Verizon уточнять выбор товаров и услуг, предлагаемых на веб-сайтах Verizon и других веб-сайтах. Рекламные сообщения могут доставляться вам через представителей Verizon, по электронной почте или с помощью других услуг и устройств Verizon. Verizon также использует эту информацию, чтобы подбирать соответствующий контент, оценивать эффективность своих сайтов и помогать пользователям в случае проблем с навигацией по веб-страницам.\n\nЕсли вы используете службу ссылочных рекомендаций Verizon, чтобы поделиться с другом страницей веб-сайта Verizon, вам предлагается самостоятельно отправить другу электронное письмо. Это следует делать только с согласия друга. Если вы перешли на сайт Verizon по ссылке, предоставленной другом, в некоторых странах Verizon может использовать предоставленную контактную информацию для отправки рекламных сообщений согласно действующим законам. В некоторых странах Verizon может в рамках действующего законодательства прослушивать и записывать телефонные разговоры с сотрудниками Verizon в целях контроля качества обслуживания, обучения персонала и обеспечения безопасности.\n\nВ соответствии с требованиями применимого законодательства мы будем предоставлять вам конкретную информацию о том, как мы используем ваши персональные данные в связи с оказанием тех или иных услуг Verizon вам или вашей компании.\n\nСогласно местному законодательству в ряде стран мы обязаны указывать законные основания для обработки компанией Verizon ваших персональных данных. В большинстве случаев мы обрабатываем ваши персональные данные для реализации наших законных деловых интересов (например, чтобы узнать, как используются наши услуги и получить сведения, которые будут использованы для разработки новых услуг), для выполнения контрактных обязательств или тогда, когда это необходимо в связи с требованиями законодательства. Когда мы обрабатываем ваши персональные данные для реализации своих законных деловых интересов, мы используем средства защиты, позволяющие сохранить неприкосновенность вашей частной жизни и соответствие наших законных интересов вашим интересам, базовым правам и свободам.\n\nВ определенных обстоятельствах (например, в связи с некоторыми видами нашей маркетинговой деятельности) и в тех случаях, когда этого требует закон, мы можем обращаться к вам за разрешением на обработку ваших персональных данных. Вы можете в любой момент связаться с нами, используя контактные данные в конце этого уведомления, и отозвать свое разрешение.\n\n#### 5. Условия предоставления персональных данных компанией Verizon третьим сторонам\n\nКак указано в этой политике конфиденциальности, политиках конфиденциальности для отдельных услуг и соглашениях с клиентами, компания Verizon передает персональные данные третьим сторонам, не входящим в группу компаний Verizon, с вашего согласия, кроме случаев, предусмотренных действующим законодательством.\n\nМы работаем в тесном сотрудничестве с другими предприятиями и компаниями, входящими в группу компаний Verizon. В связи с этим мы можем передавать им ваши персональные данные для целей внутренней отчетности, маркетинговой деятельности, изучения потребительских предпочтений, улучшения обслуживания и т. д.\n\nVerizon сотрудничает с поставщиками и партнерами, которые помогают компании предлагать, предоставлять и восстанавливать услуги, ремонтировать оборудование, собирать платежи и осуществлять другие виды деятельности. Verizon предоставляет персональные данные таким поставщиками и партнерам, когда это необходимо для выполнения работ от имени или по поручению компании. Verizon предписывает поставщикам и партнерам защищать предоставляемые им персональные данные и ограничивает использование этих данных только теми целями, для которых они были предоставлены. Verizon запрещает поставщикам и партнерам использовать эту информацию в маркетинговых целях.\n\nVerizon может также предоставлять персональные данные третьим сторонам в следующих случаях: (i) когда это требуется или разрешено согласно закону или нормативному обязательству; (ii) когда необходимо установить личность, связаться с людьми, представляющими угрозу общественной безопасности, нарушающими права собственности Verizon или препятствующими предоставлению услуг клиентам (в том числе любому действию, необходимому для взимания долга клиента) либо использованию этих услуг клиентами или прочими лицами, а также для привлечения нарушителей к суду; (iii) в связи с любой предполагаемой или фактической продажей или передачей некоторых или всех активов компании Verizon. Раскрытие персональных данных в таких случаях осуществляется только согласно действующему законодательству.\n\nНекоторые веб-сайты и услуги Verizon могут предоставляться совместно с партнерами. Если вы регистрируетесь на таких веб-сайтах или в таких службах и используете эти веб-сайты и услуги, Verizon и другие компании могут получить ваши персональные данные. Чтобы пользоваться совместно предоставляемыми услугами, вам следует также ознакомиться с политикой конфиденциальности компании-партнера, поскольку положения такой политики могут отличаться от описанных в этом документе.\n\nНа веб-сайтах и в службах Verizon могут размещаться плагины и виджеты социальных сетей или третьих сторон. Эти плагины и виджеты могут передавать связанным с ними социальным сетям и третьим сторонам сведения о ваших действиях при просмотре страниц веб-сайтов и использовании служб Verizon, даже если вы не нажимаете эти элементы и не взаимодействуете с ними иным образом.\n\nОбслуживая клиентов Verizon Enterprise Solutions в Японии, Verizon использует персональные данные клиентов совместно с другими компаниями группы Verizon следующим образом. Verizon Japan Ltd использует персональные данные, как указано в разделе 2 этой политики конфиденциальности, совместно с Verizon Business Network Services Inc. и компаниями Verizon, расположенными в странах, в которых Verizon Enterprise Solutions ведет бизнес, в целях, обозначенных в разделе 4 этой политики конфиденциальности, применяя средства, указанные в разделе 3 этой политики конфиденциальности.\n\n#### 6. Отправка персональных данных в другие страны\n\nКак член международной группы компаний при предоставлении услуг Verizon может, в соответствии с законом, передавать ваши персональные данные другим членам группы компаний Verizon, партнерам и поставщикам. Компании, которым передаются персональные данные, могут использовать их только в тех целях, для которых они были предоставлены, и обязаны защищать их от дальнейшего использования. Такие компании могут быть расположены за пределами страны вашего местонахождения. Несмотря на то, что эти компании не всегда руководствуются такими же правилами защиты данных и законами о конфиденциальности, как в стране вашего местонахождения, и могут не обеспечивать защиту, «адекватную» или «эквивалентную» требованиям к конфиденциальности в стране предоставления услуги, компания Verizon, предоставляющая услугу, обязывает своих сотрудников и сторонних поставщиков во всех странах соблюдать такой же высокий уровень защиты личной информации. В рамках части компаний группы Verizon приняты обязательные корпоративные правила передачи персональных данных. Для остальных случаев передачи персональных данных действуют защитные меры, прописанные в договорах. Ознакомиться с обязательными корпоративными правилами можно здесь: www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. Кроме того, для передачи данных может требоваться ваше согласие, за которым мы обратимся в надлежащее время.\n\n#### 7. Как Verizon защищает собираемые персональные данные?\n\nVerizon ответственно относится к конфиденциальности и безопасности клиентов. Verizon располагает техническими, административными и физическими средствами защиты от несанкционированного использования или раскрытия информации о клиентах, которую собирает и хранит компания, включая номера социального страхования. Сотрудников учат уделять особое внимание защите конфиденциальной информации клиентов и правилам предоставления доступа к ней, а также ее использования и раскрытия. Согласно правилам и политикам Verizon доступ к информации, относящейся к конкретным лицам, имеют только те сотрудники, которым это требуется для работы. Персональные и другие конфиденциальные данные не хранятся дольше, чем это нужно для ведения бизнеса, бухгалтерского учета, налогообложения или судебного производства. Verizon исполняет все действующие законы, например Основной национальный закон о налогообложении Республики Кореи, которые требуют хранить персональные данные.\n\nНесмотря на то, что Verizon прилагает значительные усилия для защиты собираемых и хранимых персональных данных, никакое программное обеспечение не может считаться абсолютно безопасным, и Verizon не может гарантировать, что предпринимаемые меры защиты способны предотвратить все попытки несанкционированного доступа, использования или раскрытия персональных данных. Verizon располагает планами защиты безопасности и реагирования на события несанкционированного доступа к конфиденциальной информации, которую компания собирает и хранит.\n\n#### 8. Права на защиту данных\n\nВ соответствии с действующим законодательством вы можете потребовать от компании Verizon предоставить доступ, обновить, уточнить, перенести, исправить и, если это практически осуществимо, удалить ваши персональные данные или отозвать свое согласие на их использование. Для осуществления своих прав вы можете отправить сообщение на адресили связаться с нами, используя приведенные ниже контактные данные компании. Обратите внимание, что в случае отзыва согласия или удаления некоторой персональной информации Verizon не сможет предоставлять вам как клиенту, поставщику или партнеру определенные услуги или отвечать на ваши запросы о приеме на работу или получении контракта на выполнение работ. Чтобы надежнее защитить вас и вашу информацию, Verizon предпринимает меры для проверки вашей личности перед тем, как предоставить доступ к вашей информации или изменить ее.\n\nЕсли вы находитесь в одной из стран ЕЭЗ, вы имеете право подать жалобу в местный орган власти, который отвечает за защиту конфиденциальности. Такое право может быть вам доступно и в других странах.\n\n#### 9.

Обновление политики\n\nVerizon оставляет за собой право вносить изменения в эту политику конфиденциальности, поэтому рекомендуем периодически проверять наличие изменений. Чтобы выяснить наличие изменений, проверьте дату вступления в силу, указанную в конце текста. Если компания Verizon решит использовать или раскрыть ваши персональные данные способом, который существенно отличается от заявленного в редакции политики, действующей на момент получения от вас этой информации, вам будет предоставлена возможность согласиться с таким способом использования или раскрытия информации или отказаться от него.\n\n**24 мая 2018 г.**",

      "content": "# Uplifting\n\neach other.\n\nInstead of allowing family issues,\n\nsocial challenges and anxiety to divide\n\nthem, these girls support each other.\n\n#### Author: Ray Roa\n\nRay Roa writes about music in beautiful Tampa, Florida. His work has appeared in Creative Loafing, Tampa Bay Times, Daily Beast and Consequence of Sound.\n\nUnless you’re from Kentucky, you’ve probably never heard of Prestonsburg; it’s a dot on the map with less than 4,000 residents. But for three weeks in the summer, Prestonsburg is the center of the world for 80 middle school girls participating in Verizon Innovative Learning. Located at Big Sandy Technical Community College, the immersive, hands-on program teaches girls how to program robots, create designs via CAD software and bring augmented and virtual reality projects to life with their Verizon devices.\n\nThe girls are from different ethnic, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of their parents are attorneys and others work for the local hospital or school.\n\nBut once the girls are together in the program, they don’t self-select into cliques. Instead, they uplift each other as they navigate social fears and learn how to collaborate, find confidence and feel empowered to work on STEM projects as a team.\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nNot afraid to ask “why.”\n\nSeventh grader Abby “AJ” Justice is always smiling. It doesn’t matter if she’s re-configuring the wiring on a robotics project or belting out a pop song at lunch. At Verizon Innovative learning, AJ is free to program robots and pose questions about why her littleBits coding isn’t working, without fear of ridicule.\n\n“At school, the answers are either right or wrong. It’s different at Verizon Innovative Learning. We’re asked to think about the why and the how of things,” AJ says, noting that this approach has helped her become a better problem solver. Verizon Innovative Learning gives AJ a sense of purpose. She’s a little bit of a mama bear to the girls and unofficial recruiter of sorts too, bringing her bestie Addison Webb and other Adams Middle School classmates into the program. Although family circumstances forced AJ to change schools, she and Addison are still close. They openly admit how much they rely on each other.\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nFrom shy girl to focused student.\n\nAJ’s enthusiasm is infectious and her positive vibes touch everyone, including Addison. “I’m a shy kid… I had a lot of anxiety,” seventh grader Addison says, while pointing to AJ. “Before this camp, I wouldn't have been able to talk to you. If you were trying to talk to me last year, I would’ve had [AJ] speak for me.” AJ nods in agreement. “We take care of each other,” she says.\n\nAddison admits that a stressful home life (she’s one of nine kids) caused her grades to slip. But it always helps to have a supportive girl squad on deck. Abby and the girls Addison met while attending Big Sandy’s Saturday sessions that lead up to the three-week program, encouraged her to focus on her studies. There was a noticeable turnaround. Her grades improved and Addison listened to speakers who stressed the importance of going to college. Higher education became something new to focus on. “I’m either going to UK or Morehead State University,” Addison says confidently.\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nGuiding and inspiring girls to be “world changers.”\n\nInfluencing girls to study and pursue STEM careers is a feel-good mission for Verizon Innovative Learning program director Traci Tackett. The longtime educator is a longtime advocate for placing advanced technology in rural schools and deleting the digital divide. During morning assembly, Traci, who’s been running Verizon Innovative Learning at Big Sandy for two years, offers the girls uplifting anecdotes that inspire them to be “world changers.”\n\nThat may sound like a simple missive, but it isn’t. Traci is keenly aware of the challenges facing her girls, especially the ones with less resources or the ones dealing with bullying or anxiety, like Addison.\n\nThat’s precisely why Traci starts the girls’ day on a motivational note. She circles the room to make eye contact with the girls, reminding them of the importance of curiosity, critical thinking and investigating solutions. “[A question] doesn’t tell the person what you don’t know,” Traci says, removing the shame around not fully understanding a coding concept. “It’s telling them what you want to know.”\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nBesties replace fear with confidence.\n\nIt’s not easy for a girl to raise her hand and announce that she doesn’t understand something. But when fifth grader Layla Vannoy started asking questions to troubleshoot issues with a 3D printer, she replaced fear with confidence. This was a huge leap for the 10-year-old who admits to having trouble learning at Porter Elementary School.\n\n“I never liked electronics, but now I wish we had these at school,” Layla says, clicking her way around the CAD program on the computer. It’s more fun here because you don’t have to take homework back home. The teachers are more understanding.” She adjusts the dimensions, before uploading her work to a USB and rushing it to a nearby classroom. There she calibrates a blue box that brings her digital vision to life. She gushes about her accomplishment to sixth grader Sidney Tackett, who shares her approval by making a funny face.\n\n“Sidney taught me how to be outgoing and introduce myself to people,” Layla shares. “Now I don’t feel as alone as I used to. I’m more open to people. I take chances and I’m willing to learn new stuff.”\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nBridging the digital divide with art and tech in Prestonsburg.\n\nThe classroom where students love taking chances belongs to art and technology instructor Leslie Heinze. Her room is a colorful mash-up of analog and digital worlds. *The Greatest Showman* soundtrack plays as girls huddle around a giant plywood mural to paint green fish, yellow stars and blue birds.\n\nAnother group holds up their Verizon devices to a mural to activate an augmented reality piece. Electronic bees zip around a painted honeycomb and a baby dances when the device hovers over a diaper. Pleased with the results, the girls smile and high five each other.\n\n(Photos: Tania Fernandez)\n\nPrestonsburg native Leslie Heinze didn’t have anything like Verizon Innovative Learning growing up. Like many of the girls in the program, she felt misunderstood and different from everyone in town.\n\nSo she headed to California for college and career. Leslie says looking at her students is like looking in a mirror. “When I left, I learned that I wasn’t different. I was just different for this place,” Leslie says, lowering the music.\n\nVerizon Innovative Learning, she says, whether the girls realize it or not, bridges the digital and economic divide. It’s also subtly changing the narrative for women growing up in a former coal town, and introducing them to new careers, like engineering. Leslie is grateful that the girls don’t have to leave Prestonsburg, like she did, to find and become supportive and tech savvy young women.\n\nMiddle school is a huge transitional period for girls, scholastically, physically and emotionally, and to have these girls uplift each other and develop self-confidence is pivotal to their development. “I feel like I can be better in a partnership. I’ve learned teamwork,” Sidney says. It’s not perfect, but I’ve learned to accept other people’s ideas and how to work through problems.”",

(\"Verizon\", \"we\", \"our\") and includes these Terms of Service, our Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\") at verizon.com/about/terms-conditions/acceptable-use-policy, Website Terms of Use, Email Policy and other Policies, as set forth at verizon.com/terms, our Return Policy at verizon.com/returnpolicy, as well as our Privacy policies located at verizon.com/privacy (collectively, \"Agreement\"). By accepting this Agreement, you agree to comply with its terms and the specific terms of the service plan you selected (including the plan's duration and applicable early termination fee). Your acceptance of this Agreement occurs by and upon the earliest of: (a) submission of your order; (b) your acceptance of the Agreement electronically or in the course of installing the Software; (c) your use of the Service; or (d) your retention of the Software we provide beyond thirty (30) days following delivery.**\n\n**The following terms apply to all Services (as defined below):**\n\n**1. Services and Definitions**. The term \"Service\" shall mean any Verizon Internet access service based on digital subscriber loop (DSL) technology including services marketed under the Basic Internet, Business Internet or DSL name with or without local service (collectively \"Basic Internet Service\"), any Verizon Internet access service delivered over a fiber optic transmission facility including services marketed as Verizon Fios Internet Service (\"Fios Service\") and the \"Value Added Services\" which may be made available to you for a separate charge or included with your Basic Internet Service or Fios Service as set forth in Attachment A hereto. If a Value Added Service is included with Basic Internet Service, Fios Service or, for example, with the rental of a particular router, and you cancel your Basic Internet Service, Fios Service or router rental, then you will no longer be entitled to receive the Value Added Service that had been so included and Verizon can terminate the Value Added Service, including without limitation deleting any data or software associated with the Value Added Service. The Service includes all Software (as defined in this Agreement), Content, domain name server (DNS), and related services (including functionality that enables the delivery of Verizon messages to your internet browser), Verizon Web Sites and such other Verizon products or services as you may subscribe to with Verizon. The Service shall also include any software or hardware that we provide you in connection with the Service to which you have subscribed and any sub- or secondary accounts associated with a primary account. \"Content\" shall mean content provided by Verizon or its third party licensors, providers or suppliers and accessible on the Service, including without limitation images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, and text, with the exception of content uploaded by and stored on behalf of users. \"Verizon Web Site(s)\" mean the sites located at verizon.com/business and business.verizon.com which are comprised of various web pages, tools, information, software, Content, and features operated by Verizon. \"Bundled Service(s)\" means a combination or \"bundle\" of Basic Internet Service or Fios Service with one or more other eligible Verizon services, including but not limited to Verizon Fios TV and voice telephone service. \"Equipment\" means any Verizon owned asset that Verizon provides to customer for use with the Service. Equipment may be either rented to Customer or provided to Customer at no additional charge, and may include, without limitation, routers, extenders or modems along with any software contained in or downloaded to such Equipment as part of the Service. At Verizon’s option, Equipment may be required to be returned to Verizon upon termination or cancellation of Service. The Equipment provided by Verizon for use with the Services may be new or refurbished. The term “Other Devices” means devices that may be used with the Service, but which are not classified as Equipment. Other Devices includes but is not limited to monitors, televisions, keyboards, laptops, CPUs, routers, or other connected devices that you purchase from Verizon or a third party. The term “Retired” means any Equipment which Verizon explicitly identifies as Retired or no longer supported or required to be returned to Verizon. You are not required to return to Verizon any devices, such as routers, that have been designated as Retired. A list of Retired devices can be found at verizon.com/biz. The term \"Service Location(s)\" refers to the physical location(s) at which the Service has been installed.\n\n**2 Term; Changes to Service.**\n\n**a. Term and Termination. **This Agreement shall be effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement, as provided above, and shall continue until you or we terminate this Agreement as permitted herein. If you subscribe to a plan with a minimum term commitment (a \"Term Plan\"), you agree to maintain your Service or Bundled Service for the duration of that Term Plan, including any renewal Terms, if applicable. Your Term Plan begins on the later of: (a) the date you change your existing Service plan to a Term Plan; or (b) the date provisioning of your Service is complete (\"Service Ready Date\"), which will be the due date established by Verizon (after the Equipment has been delivered) if you are self-installing the Service; for Bundled Services, your Term Plan begins once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. You will begin receiving any Term Plan or other discount associated with a Bundled Service plan once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. Depending on the plan selected, your Term Plan will either expire at the end of the initial minimum term commitment period or will automatically renew for the same number of months as the initial minimum term commitment period (a \"renewal Term\"). If a Term Plan expires, your Service will continue and automatically convert to month-to-month rates that may be higher than Term rates. If you subscribe to a Term Plan with automatic renewals, your Term Plan will renew after each initial and renewal Term at then-current Term rates unless you or we cancel the renewal by contacting the other within the 30 day period before or the 60 day period after the renewal date. When you select a Term Plan, the monthly rates, minimum term periods, renewal terms, early termination fee and other terms of that plan will also apply and become part of this Agreement. In the event you change Service or Bundled Service plans, your monthly rate and term commitment may change (depending on the plan you select); otherwise, the terms of this Agreement will remain in effect unless otherwise provided. We reserve the right to terminate the Service (or any part thereof) in the event we cease to offer the Service generally or to your location. If we cease offering the Service (or any part thereof), we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice.\n\n**b. Changes to Service. **WWe reserve the right to change the Service (or any part thereof), at any time with or without notice to you. If such a change materially and adversely affects your use of the Service, and we cannot reasonably mitigate the impact, then, as your sole and exclusive remedy, you may terminate the Service without further obligation.\n\n**c. Changes to Local Voice Telephone Service.** If you change or discontinue your local telephone service, we may in our discretion either terminate your Service or continue to provide Service without Verizon local voice service at the then-current rates, terms and conditions applicable to your new Service plan, and you agree to pay any new or higher monthly fee that may apply to your new Service plan. If we elect to terminate your Service under this Section 2 (c) then we reserve the right to charge any applicable early termination fees and to apply the Equipment return terms set forth in this Agreement.\n\n**d. Move/Down-grade/Up-grade Order Change Activities and Associated Fees.** You may down-grade speed connections within your selected Service plan or, subject to facilities availability, move your existing Service or phone line to another qualified Service or phone line for no additional charge; your Term Plan will not be altered as a result of such change order activity. In the event you up-grade to a Bundled Service plan, a new term commitment (depending on the plan you select) will apply starting on the effective date of your new Bundled Service plan. In the event you up-grade speed connections within your selected Service plan, additional charges may apply, subject to the terms and conditions for the new Service plan.\n\n**e. Conversion from Basic Internet Service to Fios Service**. Service is available on a limited basis based on your service address. Fios Service uses special fiber optic transmission facilities provided by your local Verizon telephone company. When Verizon is able to provision Service utilizing fiber optic technologies, we may in our discretion terminate your Basic Internet Service and cease offering Basic Internet Service to your location. In such case, we will offer you Fios Service at the then applicable rates and terms, which may differ from your previous Basic Internet Service rates and terms. As your sole and exclusive remedy, you may terminate the Service without further obligation.\n\n**3. Prices/Billing.** For any Service or Bundled Service, we will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice of a price increase in the manner set forth in Section 8 below or by United State Mail, email to your email address on file with us, or by notice on or with your bill. Prices for Term Plan Services are guaranteed until the expiration or next renewal date of the Term Plan, as applicable, subject to the provisions of this section. A price change shall not apply to a Term Plan until the next renewal date following the notice of the price change. Your continued use of the Service or Bundled Service after a price change is effective constitutes your acceptance of the price change. If you change your Service or Bundled Service or your Term Plan, you agree to pay the applicable monthly fee that may apply to your new Term Plan. You agree to pay all charges associated with the rate plan selected, including but not limited to a) applicable taxes, b) surcharges, c) Federal Universal Service Fund, tax and other recovery fees, d) telephone charges, e) activation fees, f) installation fees, g) setup fees, h) equipment charges, i) technician dispatch fees; j) early termination fees, and k) other non-recurring charges. Notwithstanding the pricing guarantee set forth above, the taxes, fees and other charges detailed in this section a) - d) may vary on a monthly basis; any variation will be reflected in your overall monthly charge. The amounts and what is included in such charges are subject to change. You also agree to pay any additional charges or fees applied to your billing account for any reason, including but not limited to interest and charges due to insufficient credit or insufficient funds. Activation fees, installation fees, setup fees, equipment charges, and other non-recurring charges, if applicable, will be included in your first month's bill. You acknowledge that you may also incur data charges or fees from a wireless or internet service provider (which may be Verizon or a third party) for accessing online services or purchasing products and services through interactive options available through the Service. You are solely responsible for all charges or fees payable to Verizon and third parties, including all applicable taxes, and you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to third parties in connection with such transactions. Monthly Service and Bundled Service recurring charges will be billed one month in advance. Billing for Service(s) will automatically begin on the Service Ready Date unless you are notified otherwise by Verizon. We may, at our election, waive any fees or charges. You will begin receiving any discount associated with a Bundled Services plan once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. Verizon or its agent will bill you directly, or bill your credit or debit card or your local Verizon telephone bill (where available in selected areas only), as you request and as approved by Verizon. IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED FOR YOUR SERVICE ON YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, VERIZON WILL CONTINUE TO BILL THE CARD UNTIL YOU TELL US TO CANCEL SUCH BILLING, AND YOU ALSO AGREE THAT VERIZON MAY RECEIVE UPDATED CARD INFORMATION FROM YOUR CARD ISSUER. IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED FOR YOUR SERVICE ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL, BY USING THE SERVICES YOU AGREE TO HAVE VERIZON CHARGES INCLUDED ON YOUR PHONE BILL. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN THAT INCLUDES PHONE SERVICE, THEN ALL OF THE SERVICES INCLUDED IN THE BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN MUST BE BILLED ON YOUR PHONE BILL. If you cancel any component of a Bundled Services plan, the monthly charges for the remaining services on your account will automatically convert to the applicable existing, non-discounted month-to-month service rate. You may only take advantage of one promotional pricing offer during any consecutive twelve-month period. Eligibility for promotional offers may be contingent upon payment of all outstanding Verizon charges. If you enroll in Verizon's Paperless Billing program, you agree to view and pay your bill electronically each month and to promptly update your e-mail address with Verizon if it changes. You will no longer receive a paper bill. Instead, each month you will receive an e-mail notifying you that your bill is available online for viewing and payment at verizon.com/business/login. You must continue to pay your paper bill until you receive your first e-mail notification that your bill is available online. If your electronic payment is rejected for any reason, Verizon may charge a return item fee (where permissible), cancel your enrollment in the Paperless Billing program and resume sending you paper bills.\n\n**4. Payment, Late Fee and Consent Regarding Credit.** We will invoice you monthly or on a prepaid basis, as applicable. Payment to Verizon is due upon receipt of invoice and shall be made in U.S. currency. A payment received thirty (30) calendar days or more after the invoice date is considered past due. If your charges are billed by your Verizon local carrier, the Late Fee will be equal to the late payment charge that the local exchange carrier applies. If your charges are not billed by your Verizon local carrier, you agree to pay interest at the rate set forth on your bill (or the maximum interest allowed by law, whichever is less). Verizon may assign unpaid delinquent charges to a collection agency for action. In the event Verizon utilizes a collection agency or takes legal action to recover monies due, you agree to reimburse Verizon for all expenses incurred to recover such monies (including attorney's fees). We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing Service. In order to establish an account with us and/or obtain or modify Service, we may obtain a report from a credit agency or exchange information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness. If you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to credit reporting agencies which will negatively affect your credit report. You may be given the option to select a prepaid service plan (\"Prepaid Service Plan\") which will begin on the later of (a) the date of your order, or (b) the date you change to the Prepaid Service Plan. There will be no refunds for Prepaid Service Plans. At the end of any Prepaid Service Plan, you may be given the option to select a new Prepaid Service Plan. If you do not select a new Prepaid Service Plan, your Service will automatically convert to the then-current month-to-month rate.\n\n**5. Refundable Deposit. **We may require that you provide us with a refundable deposit, which will be specified at the time of your order (\"Subscriber Deposit\"). We may also require an additional deposit after activation of the Service if you fail to pay any amounts when due. Within ninety (90) days after termination of your Service, we will return your Subscriber Deposit, less any unpaid amounts due on your account, including any amounts owed for unreturned or damaged Equipment. Amounts held on deposit will not accrue interest except as required by law.\n\n**6. Renewal and Cancellation; Money Back Guarantee, and Early Termination Fee. **\n\n**a. Renewal or Cancellation**. Upon expiration or cancellation of the Term Plan, we may continue to provide you with Service on a month-to-month basis, at our then-current monthly price. You may contact us to subscribe to another available Term Plan at then-current Term rates. If you subscribe to an automatic renewal Term Plan, your Term Plan will automatically renew at the end of the initial Term and at the end of each successive renewal Term, at the then-current Term rates, unless you contact us to cancel within 30 days before or 60 days after the renewal date. Verizon will provide you a reminder before each renewal date. If you wish to cancel your Service or renewal, or wish to select another plan, you may do so by calling 1-800-VERIZON (800-837-4966).\n\n**b. Money Back Guarantee. **If we provide a money-back guarantee (\"MBG\") for your Service, it will begin when billing for your Service starts. During any applicable MBG period you may cancel the Service and receive a full refund of all monthly charges paid as well as any one-time charges and Equipment charges paid to Verizon (provided you return all Equipment in good working condition). An early termination fee will not apply to Service terminated within a MBG period, if one is provided. A MBG, if applicable, will not apply if you change between or renew service plans. You are limited to a maximum of one MBG per Service type per Service address.\n\n**c. Early Termination Fee.** Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, if Service provided pursuant to a Term Plan is removed or terminated by you (or by us if you breach this Agreement) before you have completed the then-current initial or renewal Term, then you agree to pay Verizon the early termination fee set forth in the pricing plan you have chosen. It is agreed that Verizon's damages, if you cancel your Service, are difficult or impossible to ascertain; therefore, the provisions of this Section are intended to establish liquidated damages in the event of cancellation and are not intended as a penalty. In addition, if you cancel Service after any applicable MBG period, you agree to pay us all Service fees accrued as of the cancellation date.\n\n**7. No Warranties. **ADVICE OR INFORMATION GIVEN BY VERIZON, ITS REPRESENTATIVES OR ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT CREATE A WARRANTY. USE OF VERIZON TECHNICAL SUPPORT (INCLUDING SUPPORT PROVIDED BY ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS) IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS NOT WARRANTED.

YOU AGREE THAT THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS\n\nIN ADDITION, VERIZON AND/OR ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS, AS APPLICABLE, DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT SERVICE CAN BE PROVISIONED TO YOUR LOCATION, OR THAT PROVISIONING WILL OCCUR ACCORDING TO A SPECIFIED SCHEDULE. THE PROVISIONING AND PERFORMANCE (SPEED) OF THE SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO CIRCUIT OR OTHER NETWORK FACILITY AVAILABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOOP LENGTH, THE CONDITION OF YOUR TELEPHONE LINE AND WIRING INSIDE YOUR LOCATION, AND COMPUTER/DEVICE CONFIGURATION AND CAPABILITIES AND NETWORK/INTERNET CONGESTION, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT YOUR LINE IS NOT PROVISIONED FOR ANY REASON, NEITHER YOU NOR VERIZON SHALL HAVE ANY DUTIES OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN YOUR OBLIGATION TO RETURN ANY VERIZON-PROVIDED EQUIPMENT). VERIZON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR EQUIPMENT PROVIDED BY VERIZON WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS, PERFORM AT A PARTICULAR SPEED, BANDWIDTH OR DATA THROUGHPUT RATE, OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES, WORMS, DISABLING CODE OR CONDITIONS, OR THE LIKE. VERIZON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR YOUR EQUIPMENT WILL NOT BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY NETWORK-RELATED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MODIFICATIONS, UPGRADES, MONITORING, SCANNING OR SIMILAR ACTIVITIES.\n\n**8.

Customer Equipment. **You are solely responsible for obtaining, installing, configuring, and maintaining suitable equipment and software, including any necessary system or software updates, patches or other fixes, which are or may become necessary to access the Service, and to operate your computer.

Service Availability and Performance.** The Service you select may not be available in all areas or at the rates, speeds, or bandwidth generally marketed, and some locations will not qualify for the Service even if initial testing showed that your line was qualified. We will provision qualified Basic Internet lines at the maximum line rate available to your location based on our standard line qualification procedures, unless you have selected a level of service with a lower maximum line rate. You understand that fiber and DSL bandwidth is provided on a per line basis, and that the speed and bandwidth available to each computer or device connected to the network will vary depending upon the number and types of computers or devices using the Service and the type of use (e.g. streaming media or downloading larger files), as well as based on network congestion and the speed of servers you access on the Internet, among other factors. The speed of the Service will vary based on network or Internet congestion, your computer configuration, your use of Fios TV video on demand service, if applicable, the condition of your telephone line and the wiring inside your location, among other factors.

These security measures may include but are not limited to, the use of firewalls and blocklists to block potentially harmful or abusive emails or attachments, anti-spam filters, anti-virus or anti-spyware software, or blocking selected ports. Such activities may result in the blocking, filtering or non-delivery of legitimate and non-legitimate email sent to or from your email account. By using any Verizon-provided email service, you agree that delivery and receipt of email is not guaranteed and to Verizon's use of such Internet and email security measures we in our sole discretion deem appropriate.\n\n**d.

The parties further agree that this Agreement does not permit class arbitration, even if the procedures or rules of the American Arbitration Association (or other dispute resolution organization or body) would otherwise permit it.\n\n**b.** At the written request of a party, each party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The parties intend that these negotiations be conducted by non-lawyer, business representatives. The location, format, frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may mutually agree to utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as confidential information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any lawsuit without the concurrence of all parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications that are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.\n\n**c.** If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of the initial written request, and the amount in controversy exceeds five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars or the jurisdictional limit for small claims court in the jurisdiction in which service is provided (whichever is less), the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. A party may demand such arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in those rules. Discovery shall be controlled by the arbitrator and shall be permitted to the extent set out in this section. Each party may submit in writing to a party, and that party shall so respond, to a maximum of any combination of twenty-five (25) (none of which may have subparts) of the following: interrogatories, demands to produce documents and requests for admission. Each party is also entitled to take the oral deposition of one (1) individual representing another party. Additional discovery may be permitted upon mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration hearing shall be commenced within sixty (60) calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in the county where Service is provided to you by Verizon. The arbitrator shall control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The parties may submit written briefs. The arbitrator shall rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of hearings. The times specified in this section may be changed upon mutual agreement of the parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n\n**d. **If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of the initial written request, and the amount in controversy does not exceed five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars or the jurisdictional limit for small claims court in the jurisdiction is which service is provided (whichever is less), the dispute may be submitted to small claims court in the jurisdiction in which service is provided for resolution in accordance with its rules and procedures.\n\n**e. **Each party shall bear its own costs of these procedures. A party seeking discovery shall reimburse the responding party the costs of production of documents (to include reasonable search time and reproduction costs). The parties shall equally split the fees of the arbitration and the arbitrator.\n\n**18. Limitation of Liability**. IN NO EVENT SHALL VERIZON OR ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS, PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR (A) ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO DATA ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (B) ANY CLAIMS AGAINST YOU BY ANY THIRD PARTY.\n\n**19. Limitation of Damages. **OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY NON-INSTALLATION, SECURITY BREACH, FAILURE OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED A PRO RATA CREDIT FOR THE MONTHLY FEES (EXCLUDING ALL TAXES) YOU HAVE PAID TO VERIZON FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO WHEN SUCH CLAIM AROSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n**20.

Verizon does not guarantee that your choice of names is or will continue to be available for use as a domain name. In order to receive a domain name, you must agree and remain agreeable through the use of the domain name, to the TPDNVs' terms of service which the TPDNV may change at any time in their sole discretion. You understand that you will be subject to a separate contractual relationship between you and the TPDNV, and that you, and not Verizon or its licensors or its affiliates, are responsible for all liability and obligations in connection with that relationship. For more information, please see the Domain Name Services Agreement located at verizon.com/terms.\n\n**c.** Except as otherwise provided by your Service or Bundled Service plan, all fees associated with domain name registration and periodic maintenance or renewal of domain names, are your responsibility. Verizon will bill such fees to you on a monthly basis until such time that you notify Verizon that you no longer wish for Verizon to be the administrative contact for your domain. Prior to providing the Service to you, Verizon will verify that you own or control the domain names you specify. If you do not own or control the domain names, then Verizon will have no obligation to provide you with the Service.\n\n**22. Force Majeure.** If the performance of any obligation hereunder is interfered with by reason of any circumstance beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, labor strikes and other labor disturbances, power surges or failures, or the act or omission of any third party, we shall be excused from such performance to the extent necessary, provided that we shall use reasonable efforts to remove such causes of non-performance.\n\n**23.

Verizon's failure at any time to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any right or remedy available hereunder or at law or equity, or to exercise any option herein provided shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision, right, remedy or option or in any other way affect the validity of this Agreement.

Services. **The term \"Service\" shall mean Verizon FiosSM Internet Service for Business (\"Verizon Fios IS\"), Verizon Business E-Mail Service (\"E-M Service\"), Dial-Up Mobility Broadband Internet Service (\"Mobility Service\"), including all Software (as defined in Paragraph 9 below), and such other products or services as you may subscribe to with Verizon. The Service shall also include any software or hardware that we provide you in connection with the Service to which you have subscribed.\n\n**2. Term.** This Agreement shall be effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement, as provided above, and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter, or for twenty-four (24) months thereafter if you have selected premium-grade Verizon Fios IS, (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, it shall continue on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party as permitted by this Agreement. We reserve the right to terminate the Service (or any part thereof) in the event we cease to offer the Service. If we cease offering the Service (or any part thereof), we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice. Billing on your account will begin following completion of provisioning of the Service.\n\n**3. Prices.** Prices are guaranteed for the Initial Term of Service. For any Service offered on a month-to-month basis, we will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice of a price change. Thereafter, your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of the price change. You are responsible for all charges associated with the Service and rate plan selected, including applicable equipment charges, termination fees, taxes, usage charges, tariffs, telecommunications surcharges, Supplier FUSF charges or other applicable governmental charges due on account of the Services. Such charges may change on a monthly or other periodic basis and we reserve the right to make any changes in these charges with or without prior notice to you.\n\n**4. Payment and Late Fee. **We will invoice you monthly. Payment to Verizon is due upon receipt of invoice and shall be made in U.S. currency. A payment received thirty (30) calendar days or more after the invoice date is considered past due. If your charges are billed by your Verizon local carrier, the Late Fee will be equal to the late payment charge that the local exchange carrier applies. If your charges are not billed by your Verizon local carrier, you agree to pay interest of 1.5% for each month or part of a month (or the maximum interest allowed by law, whichever is less). Verizon may assign unpaid delinquent charges to a collection agency for action. If Verizon uses legal action to recover monies due, you agree to reimburse Verizon for all expenses incurred to recover such monies (including attorney's fees). You also authorize Verizon to conduct a credit search which we may use to determine your credit worthiness. Verizon may cancel our order or terminate this Agreement if, in its sole opinion, the results of such credit search are deemed unacceptable.\n\n**5. No Warranties**.

The parties intend that these negotiations be conducted by non-lawyer, business representatives. The location, format, frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may mutually agree to utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as confidential information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any lawsuit without the concurrence of all parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications that are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.\n\nIf the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of the initial written request, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. A party may demand such arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in those rules. Discovery shall be controlled by the arbitrator and shall be permitted to the extent set out in this section. Each party may submit in writing to a party, and that party shall so respond, to a maximum of any combination of twenty-five (25) (none of which may have subparts) of the following: interrogatories, demands to produce documents and requests for admission. Each party is also entitled to take the oral deposition of one (1) individual representing another party. Additional discovery may be permitted upon mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration hearing shall be commenced within sixty (60) calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in Fairfax County of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The arbitrator shall control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The parties may submit written briefs. The arbitrator shall rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of hearings. The times specified in this section may be changed upon mutual agreement of the parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n\nEach party shall bear its own costs of these procedures. A party seeking discovery shall reimburse the responding party the costs of production of documents (to include reasonable search time and reproduction costs). The parties shall equally split the fees of the arbitration and the arbitrator.\n\n\n**16.

Any special equipment or facilities necessary to achieve compatibility between carriers are the sole responsibility of Customer.\n\n**13.** Inspection, Testing and Adjustment\n\n**13.1** Company may, with or without notice, make such tests and inspections as may be necessary to determine whether Agreement requirements are being complied with in the installation, operation, and maintenance of Customer's or Company's equipment or services. Company may, without notice, interrupt Service at any time, as necessary, because of a departure from any of these requirements and may continue such interruption until its requirements have been satisfied.\n\n**13.2** Upon reasonable notice, the facilities provided by Company shall be made available to Company by Customer for such tests and adjustments as may be necessary for their maintenance to a condition satisfactory to Company.\n\n**13.3** Company shall not be liable to Customer for any damages for Service interruption pursuant to this Section.\n\n**14.** Interruption of Service\n\n**14.1** It shall be the obligation of Customer to notify Company of any interruption of Service. Before giving such notice, Customer shall ascertain that the trouble is not being caused by any action or omission of Customer or is not in wiring or equipment connected to the terminal of Company. Company's liability for Service interruption is limited according to the provisions of Section 3.\n\n**14.2** When Service is interrupted for four hours or more, Company will, upon request by Customer, issue a credit, computed as set forth below, provided such interruption is not determined by Company to have been caused by the negligence or willful action of Customer, or any other person at Customer's terminal location, or by the failure of Customer's equipment or power supply.\n\n**14.3** Credit is computed by multiplying the monthly rate for Service by the ratio that the number of hours in the period of interruption bears to 720 hours. For the purpose of this computation, each month shall be considered to have 720 hours. The credit shall be based upon the non-usage charges for the month during which the interruption occurred, excluding equipment and access line charges.\n\n**14.4** An interruption is measured from the time Company detects trouble or Customer notifies Company of the interruption by an expeditious means, until the trouble is cleared. Each interruption is considered separately for the purposes of establishing credit allowance. No credit shall be given for an interruption of Service of less than four hours. The credit for a billing period shall not exceed the monthly rate.\n\n**14.5** Credit for interruption of Service does not apply when such credit is limited under the rates, terms and conditions of the specific Service involved.\n\n**15.** Provision of Service\n\nServices are provided only in those geographic areas where facilities exist, where Company has in its discretion determined (subject to applicable law) to provide Services, and where Company is authorized to provide Services. Provision of Services offered under this Agreement are subject to availability.\n\n**16.** Changes or Updates to the Services or to this Agreement.\n\n**16.1** Verizon reserves the right to make changes to the Service or any portion thereof. If such a change materially and adversely affects your use of the Service, and Verizon cannot reasonably mitigate the impact, then Customer may terminate the Service within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the change without further obligation by providing written notice to Verizon.\n\n**16.2** Verizon may revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement from time to time by posting such revisions located at Site Policies. Customer agrees to visit this website periodically to be aware of and review any such revisions. Increases to the monthly price of the Service shall be effective thirty (30) days after posting; revisions to any other terms and conditions shall be effective upon posting. By continuing to use the Service after revisions are in effect, Customer accepts and agrees to the revisions and to abide by them.\n\n**17.** Applicable Law\n\nThe construction, interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. All disputes relating to this Agreement shall be resolved through the application of such laws. Verizon and Customer each irrevocably consents to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of New York, State of New York in all matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, and waives any defense of lack of jurisdiction, improper venue or inconvenient forum\n\n**18.** Miscellaneous.\n\n**18.1** The terms and conditions of this Agreement supersede all previous agreements, proposals or representations related to the Service.\n\n**18.2** Any notices or demands or other communications which under the terms of this Agreement or under any statute must or may be given or made by either party shall be in writing to the respective parties as set forth herein.

Rate Plans **\n\n**One-Year Term Plan **\n\n**A. Description **\n\nVerizon Infospeed DSL Solutions One-Year Term Plan provides Verizon Customers discounted rates based on commitments of a specific term. The One-Year Term Plan encompasses all of Customer's Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements.\n\nIf Customer is not the end user of the Service, then Customer who purchases Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under the One-Year Term Plan assumes the following obligations:\n\nCustomer will submit orders to Company electronically in a format and manner designated by Company;\n\nCustomer will provision all Customer premises equipment to its end users;\n\nCustomer will deal directly with its end users and will be solely liable with respect to all matters relating to the Service, including marketing, ordering, installation, maintenance, repair, billing and collections; and\n\nCustomer will not direct its end users to contact Company regarding any aspect of the Service.\n\nTwo rate schedules are available for the One-Year Term Plan:\n\nSchedule I is available to Customers that subscribe to the One-Year Term Plan on or before August 31, 2001.\n\nSchedule II is available to Customers that subscribe to the One-Year Term Plan on or after September 1, 2001.\n\nAt expiration of the One-Year Term Plan, Customer may choose to convert to the month-to-month rates, or continue with rates, charges, terms and conditions in effect at the end of the expiring Term Plan on a year-to-year basis. A conversion to month-to-month rates, or discontinuance, will require that Customer submit a service change order.\n\nOne-Year Term Plans are subject to payments for early termination.\n\n**B. Termination without Liability **\n\nCustomer may terminate a term plan without termination liability should the monthly rates increase during the term of the existing term plan. Subsequent to a rate increase, Customer must either elect to terminate the term plan without liability or continue the term plan at the new rate.\n\nEnd users subscribing to Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement(s) under a one-year term who change to an ISP/Content Provider subscribing to Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under a Five-Year Term and Volume Discount.\n\nPlan are automatically included in the ISP/Content Provider's Five-Year TVDP. No termination liability applies to the terminated one-year term plan of the end user.\n\n**C. Termination Liability **\n\nIf Customer elects to discontinue its term plan prior to the end of the commitment period, termination liability charges will apply. Liability will be the difference between what would have been charged had Customer had the month- to-month rate for each Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement in-service at the end of each month Customer subscribed to the term plan less all payments made and owed.\n\nFive-Year Term and Volume Discount Plan (TVDP)\n\n**A. Description **\n\nVerizon Infospeed DSL Solutions Five-Year Term and Volume Discount Plan (5N-TVDP) provides Customers discounted rates for Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions based on commitments of a specific term with minimum volumes. Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions is subject to the terms and conditions set forth above.\n\nA Customer who purchases Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under the 5N-TVDP assumes the following obligations:\n\nCustomer will submit orders to Company electronically in a format and manner designated by Company;\n\nCustomer will provision all Customer premises equipment to its end users;\n\nCustomer will deal directly with its end users and will be solely liable with respect to all matters relating to the Service, including marketing, ordering, installation, maintenance, repair, billing and collections; and\n\nCustomer will not direct its end users to contact Company regarding any aspect of the Service.\n\nCustomer agrees to be billed via Company's standard billing system for Infospeed DSL.\n\nThe 5N-TVDP has three optional volume Commitment Levels, A, B and C. Each Commitment Level has minimum service arrangement volumes assigned for each year of the plan. The Commitment Level includes all of Customer's billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions and Premium DSL arrangements. Commitment Levels are selected by Customer and must be designated in Customer's order for 5N-TVDP. The Commitment Levels are specified following.\n\nCustomer with an existing 1-Year Term Plan may migrate all existing Service arrangements to a 5N-TVDP without termination liability.\n\nAt the expiration of a 5N-TVDP, Customer may commit to a new 5N-TVDP, convert to month-to-month or One-Year Term Plan rates as specified above, or continue with rates, charges, terms and conditions in effect at the end of the expiring 5N-TVDP on a year-to-year basis. A commitment to a new 5N-TVDP, conversion to month-to-month or One-Year Term Plan rates, or a request to discontinue Service will require that Customer submit a service change order.\n\nThe 5N-TVDP is subject to payments for missed annual commitments (\"Shortfall Liability\") and for early termination (\"Termination Liability\").\n\n**B. Annual Review **\n\nThe Commitment Level is reviewed at the end of each Subscription Year on the service anniversary date. A count is taken of all billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements as of the last day of the Subscription Year. Customers who do not meet the minimum quantity of billed arrangements for their Commitment Level on such date will be so notified.\n\nSubscription Year One will begin on the service anniversary date, which is the Subscription Date indicated on the Application For Service agreement signed by the Company and the Customer. Each Subscription Year runs 12 months from its service anniversary date.\n\nIf, at the annual review, the total quantity of billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements that Customer has on the last day of the Subscription Year does not meet the respective minimum Annual Commitment Level, a Shortfall Liability will be assessed. In addition, Customers with Commitment Levels B and C with less than the minimum arrangement volumes will be reassigned to a reduced Commitment Level for the next year based on their current arrangement volume (e.g., a 5N-TVDP Customer in Commitment Level C with 125,000 arrangements billed at the end of year three would be placed in Commitment Level B for year four).\n\nAt the end of any Subscription Year, Customer may elect to move to a higher Commitment Level for the next Subscription Year and for the remainder of the 5N-TVDP, if it has met the minimum arrangement volume for its existing Commitment Level. However, should Customer fail to meet the minimum arrangement volume for the higher Commitment Level by the end of the Subscription Year following such election, an additional charge will be assessed equal to 10% of the Shortfall Liability for the Subscription Year, as specified below.\n\n**C. Shortfall Liability **\n\nShortfall liability applies to any 5N-TVDP Customer that fails to meet the minimum arrangement volumes for its designated commitment level.\n\nShortfall liability is based on the difference between the monthly rate for the designated commitment level and the monthly rate for the commitment level that should have been charged based upon the actual quantity of billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements at the end of the Subscription Year. The shortfall liability is equal to the difference in the monthly rate multiplied by the sum of all arrangements billed at the end of each month during such Subscription Year. For example, at the end of Subscription Year Two, a 5N-TVDP Customer with Commitment Level C and only 10,000 arrangements in-service will be assessed the difference in the monthly rate between Commitment Level B and Commitment Level C for each arrangement billed at the end of each month during the Subscription Year.\n\nCustomer may stay in its commitment level by paying an alternative shortfall liability equal to the minimum arrangement volume applicable to its Commitment Level less the actual number of Verizon Infospeed DSL arrangements billed at the end of the Subscription Year multiplied by the current monthly rate for the selected commitment level, multiplied by six.\n\nAn additional payment of 10% of the shortfall liability is assessed those Customers who fail to meet the minimum arrangement volume after moving to a higher commitment level the previous year.\n\nCustomers who fall below the minimum arrangement volume for Commitment Level A in any Subscription Year will be terminated from the 5N-TVDP and will be subject to termination liability. All of Customer's Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements will revert to the basic month-to-month rates.\n\nIf a Customer falls below the minimum volume for Commitment Level A and is terminated from the 5N-TVDP twice, in consecutive Subscription Years, the Customer may not subscribe to any term plan for 12 months after being moved to month-to-month rates.\n\n**D. Termination Without Liability **\n\nCustomer may terminate a 5N-TVDP without termination liability or shortfall liability should the monthly rates increase during the term of the existing 5N-TVDP, exclusive of any increase due to local, state or federal fees, taxes or surcharges. Subsequent to a rate increase, Customer must either elect to terminate the plan without liability or continue the 5N-TVDP at the new rate. Customer's continuation in the 5N-TVDP 30 days or more following a rate increase shall constitute Customer's election to continue the plan at the new rate.\n\n**E. Termination Liability **\n\nIf Customer elects to discontinue its 5N-TVDP prior to the end of the commitment period, termination liability charges will apply. Liability will be the difference between what would have been charged had Customer had the month-to-month rate set forth in Section V.A, below for each Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement billed at the end of each month Customer subscribed to the 5N-TVDP less all payments made and owed, including any shortfall liability payments made and owed.\n\n**V.

The charge applies to all available Verizon DSL Over Resold Lines speeds and is in addition to the rates and charges for the associated Verizon DSL Over Resold Lines arrangement.\n\nIf a customer elects to disconnect Direct PVC Premium Service and maintain the underlying Verizon DSL Over Resold Lines service arrangement, a new Service Activation Charge, as specified in Section V.C, below,, will apply.\n\n**IV. Rate Plans **\n\n**One-Year Term Plan **\n\n**A. **Description\n\nVerizon DRL One-Year Term Plan provides Verizon Customers discounted rates based on commitments of a specific term. The One-Year Term Plan encompasses all of Customer's Verizon DRL arrangements.\n\nCustomer who purchases Verizon DRL under the One-Year Term Plan assumes the following obligations:\n\nCustomer will submit orders to Company electronically in a format and manner designated by Company;\n\nCustomer will provision all Customer premises equipment to its end users;\n\nCustomer will deal directly with its end users and will be solely liable with respect to all matters relating to the Service, including marketing, ordering, installation, maintenance, repair, billing and collections; and\n\nCustomer will not direct its end users to contact Company regarding any aspect of the Service.\n\nAt expiration of the One-Year Term Plan, Customer may choose to convert to the month-to-month rates, or continue with rates, charges, terms and conditions in effect at the end of the expiring Term Plan on a year-to-year basis. A conversion to month-to-month rates, or discontinuance, will require that Customer submit a service change order.\n\nOne-Year Term Plans are subject to payments for early termination.\n\n**B.** Termination without Liability\n\nCustomer may terminate a term plan without termination liability should the monthly rates increase during the term of the existing term plan. Subsequent to a rate increase, Customer must either elect to terminate the term plan without liability or continue the term plan at the new rate.\n\nEnd users subscribing to Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement(s) under a one-year term who change to an ISP/Content Provider subscribing to Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under a Five-Year Term and Volume Discount Plan are automatically included in the ISP/Content Provider's Five-Year TVDP. No termination liability applies to the terminated one-year term plan of the end user.\n\n**C. **Termination Liability\n\nIf Customer elects to discontinue its term plan prior to the end of the commitment period, termination liability charges will apply. Liability will be the difference between what would have been charged had Customer had the month- to-month rate for each Verizon DRL arrangement in-service at the end of each month Customer subscribed to the term plan less all payments made and owed.\n\n**V.

Capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement unless otherwise defined in this Attachment 3. **\n\n**Effective December 1, 2008, Verizon Infospeed Premium DSL Service is no longer available to Customers. However, Verizon will continue to support such existing Customer Premium DSL accounts after November 30, 2008 under the following terms and conditions. **\n\n**I. Service Description **\n\nPremium DSL is a high-speed symmetrical (upstream and downstream data rates are equal) data-only access service. Premium DSL also features static IP Addressing, Variable Bit Rate Non-Real Time Quality of Service and support for multiple users. The service uses DSL technology to transport data over compatible facilities to an end user premises. Data traffic generated by a customer-provided modem is transported to the Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point. From there, the traffic is transported to the end user's Information Service Provider (ISP) or content provider via other Telephone Company services.\n\n**A. **Static IP Addressing - The Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to a computer never changes. The static IP address becomes the permanent address of the computer on the internet, making it possible for other Internet users to locate and connect to the computer.\n\n**B. **Variable Bit Rate Non-Real Time Quality of Service - Provides customers with traffic prioritization throughout the ATM network. For example, during times of congestion on the network, the data of Premium DSL customers will have a significantly higher bandwidth prioritization (i.e., low cell loss) over the data of other non-Premium DSL customers.\n\nFive service level tiers of Premium DSL are available:\n\n(1) 192/192 Kbps\n\n(2) 384/384 Kbps\n\n(3) 768/768 Kbps\n\n(4) 1.1/1.1 Mbps\n\n(5) 1.5/1.5 Mbps\n\nThe data speeds listed above are maximum speeds. Actual speeds may be lower due to the impact of loop distance, modem technology and other factors.\n\n**II. Terms and Conditions **\n\n**A. **The minimum service period for Premium DSL is one year. In the event Premium DSL is disconnected in less than one year, a minimum service period charge, as described below, will be assessed.\n\n**B. **Premium DSL is provided subject to the availability and limitations of Telephone Company facilities and related equipment.\n\n**C. **The Company will provision and maintain Premium DSL from the Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point to the network interface device (NID) at the designated end user premises. The Company will advise the customer of any additional equipment necessary to support Premium DSL. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary additional equipment, such as a compatible DSL modem.\n\n**D. **Access from Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point may be provided via Telephone Company data network interface services such as Frame Relay Service, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Service and dedicated Special Access services. The regulations, rates and charges for the specific type of service apply as specified in other Telephone Company tariff(s) from which the service is ordered and are in addition to rates and charges for Premium DSL.\n\n**E.** The customer will provide the Company with the necessary information (e.g., name and address/location, telephone number, serving area, etc., related to end user and ISP/Content Provider) to provision Premium DSL.\n\n**F. **The Company will obtain qualification information on facilities to determine suitability of such facilities for Premium DSL. The Company will not provide Premium DSL on facilities that are unsuitable for the Service, nor will the Company provide Premium DSL if it determines that such provision will produce interference to other services.\n\n**G. **The Company reserves the right to temporarily interrupt Premium DSL for maintenance, software upgrade and in emergency situations. The customer will obtain authorization from the end user to allow the Company employees or its authorized agents to enter end user's designated premises at any reasonable hour for the purpose of installing, inspecting or repairing the Premium DSL arrangement. The customer will also obtain permission from the end user, upon termination of Premium DSL, to allow Company employees or its authorized agents to enter the premises at a reasonable hour to remove any Company equipment. The customer will present evidence of such authorizations to the Company upon request. The Company may terminate an end user's Premium DSL in the event such authorizations are not obtained and maintained.\n\n**H. **Scheduled maintenance activities that adversely affect Service will be conducted during pre-determined maintenance windows at time intervals that have the least likelihood of interruption to Service during peak usage periods.\n\n**III. Rate Regulations **\n\n**A**. Monthly Rate - A monthly recurring charge applies for each Premium DSL arrangement.\n\n**B.** DSL Installation Charge - A nonrecurring DSL Installation Charge applies for the installation/acquisition of loop facilities from the Premium DSL Connection Point to the end user's premises.\n\n**C. **Service Activation - A nonrecurring charge applies for the initial service activation associated with each Premium DSL arrangement.\n\n**D. **ISP/Content Provider Charge - A nonrecurring charge applies for activities associated with a change in ISP/Content Provider for each Premium DSL arrangement changed.\n\n**E.** Speed Change/Downward - A nonrecurring charge applies for activities associated with a downward change in speed from one service type to another with each Premium DSL arrangement changed.\n\n**F.** Speed Change/Upward - No nonrecurring charge applies for activities associated with an upward change in speed from one service type to another with each Premium DSL arrangement changed.\n\n**G.** Software Change - A nonrecurring charge applies for a software change associated with the remapping of circuit information or other software changes associated with a Premium DSL arrangement. This charge is applied on a per software change basis. This charge also applies when the customer's Premium DSL service is validly assigned, or when the customer's Premium DSL service is suspended and transitioned to a new provider due to nonpayment. In this case, the software change charge applies to the new provider on a per software change basis.\n\n**IV. Minimum Service Period Charge **\n\n**A. **The customer may disconnect Premium DSL without a minimum service period charge should the monthly rate increase during the term of the existing one year commitment, exclusive of any increase due to local, state or federal fees, taxes or surcharges. The Telephone Company will notify the customer in advance of any upcoming rate increase in order to allow sufficient time for the customer to determine if it wishes to disconnect Premium DSL.\n\n**B. **Upon notification by the Telephone Company of an upcoming rate increase, the customer must either elect to disconnect the service without liability or continue the service at the new rate. The customer's continuation of Premium DSL 30 days or more following a rate increase shall constitute the customer's election to continue at the new rate.\n\n**C. **If a customer elects to discontinue Premium DSL prior to the end of the one year minimum service period without the occurrence of a Premium DSL rate increase, a minimum service period charge will apply. The minimum service period charge is equal to the lesser of $250.00, or the monthly rate for the customer's Service, as set forth herein, times the number of months remaining in the initial one year minimum service period.\n\n**V. Rates and Charges **\n\n| A. Monthly Rates | Monthly Rate | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Premium DSL 192 Kbps | $ 85.00 | |\n| Premium DSL 384 Kbps | $ 108.00 | |\n| Premium DSL 768 Kbps | $ 125.00 | |\n| Premium DSL 1.1 Mbps | $ 163.00 | |\n| Premium DSL 1.5 Mbps | $ 222.00 |\n\n\n| C. Non-Recurring Charges* | Nonrecurring Charges | |\n|---|---|---|\n| DSL Installation Charge | $ 150.00 | |\n| Service Activation | $ 60.00 | |\n| ISP/Content Provider Change | $ 60.00 | |\n| Speed Change-Downward | $ 35.00 | |\n| Speed Change-Upward | $ 00.00 | |\n| Software Change | $ 00.00 |",

      "content": "# Verizon Candidate\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis Notice explains how Verizon will use your personal data relating to the talent acquisition, recruitment and pre-hire process. It applies to you if you are applying for a role at Verizon or if you are interested in joining a Verizon talent network. Additional information relating to the processing of your personal data by Verizon is contained in Verizon’s International Privacy Notice for individuals residing in non-US countries and our California Personnel Notice for individuals in California.\n\nWhen we refer to \"Verizon\" in this document we mean the Verizon company that is providing you with the Verizon Careers website (Verizon Corporate Resources Group LLC) and any Verizon company to which you are applying for a role. In some countries these Verizon companies would be known as the Data Controllers under data protection laws. If you are applying to roles with more than one Verizon company, each of them will be acting as the Data Controller of your personal data because they each will decide how it will be used.If you have any questions about any aspect of this notice or how Verizon handles your information, you can contact the appropriate Privacy Team based on your location.\n\nIf you are based in the US: Privacy Inquiries Form\n\nIf you are based outside the US: International-Data-Privacy@verizon.com\n\n## 1.

We may ask you for additional personal data to assist us with our recruitment process and in the event you are offered a job.\n\nYou may also be asked to provide Verizon with personal data of other people. For example, we may ask you to provide the contact information of your previous employer so that Verizon can validate your previous experience. In those circumstances, you will need to ask those people for permission to share their personal data with us, and for Verizon to use it in accordance with this privacy notice; you can share this notice with them. Your previous employer might ask you for your confirmation that they can share information with Verizon.\n\nWe will also collect some information from you automatically when you use our websites, including data collected using cookies and other device identifying technologies. More information about the way we use this information is available in the International Privacy Notice for individuals residing in non-US countries and our California Personnel Notice for individuals in California.\n\nWe are required in some locations including the US to ask you about your disability status, gender, race, ethnicity, and veteran status. You are not required to provide this information, and declining to provide it will not subject you to any adverse treatment. Alternatively, you might voluntarily provide Verizon with information of this type, or information about your health.\n\nIf you send us your resume or CV by email or by post, or ask an existing Verizon employee to pass it to the Talent Acquisition team, the personal data it contains will be processed in accordance with this notice.\n\n## 2.

Third parties who receive personal data might be located in the United States or in other countries. Some of these countries might not provide the same legal protections for personal data as your home country. In addition, personal data might be accessible by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in the countries where it is located. In these circumstances your personal data is protected as required by law as outlined in the Section 8 “How is my personal data protected?”.\n\n## 8. How is my personal data protected?\n\nVerizon is committed to maintaining the security of your personal data and has comprehensive corporate policies regarding information security.

You can do this by contacting your recruitment contact at Verizon or through the International Privacy Request form.\n- The right to contact the supervisory data protection authority in your home country if you have a formal complaint or objection regarding the processing of your personal data by Verizon.\n- The right to lodge a complaint with the supervising data protection authority of your home country if you believe there has been a breach of your privacy rights.\n\nLocal laws might provide additional rights to you.\n\nIf you no longer want to be contacted by Verizon about other job opportunities or if any of the information that you have provided to Verizon changes (for example if you change your e-mail address, name or postal address) you can update or amend your information at any time by:\n\n- Logging into your account on the Verizon careers portal and changing your preferences and information;\n- Using an unsubscribe option included in email correspondence;\n- Sending an email to us at privacyoffice@verizon.com (if you are in the US) or International-Data-Privacy@verizon.com (if you are outside the US); or\n\nYou can also ask us to remove personal information about you or limit its use by deleting your Verizon Careers account.\n\n## 9.

      "content": "# ZenKey by Verizon Terms of Service and end user license agreement\n\nThese Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a legally binding agreement between you as our Customer (“You” or “Your”) and Verizon wireless (“Verizon”, “We” or “Us”). They set forth the terms and conditions under which You agree to use the ZenKey powered by Verizon app (the “App”). Verizon may make updates to these Terms at any time by posting them so you should check regularly for updates. Use of the App is also subject to Your Customer Agreement, including the dispute resolution provisions. By continuing to use the App after we have notified You of changes, You agree to accept those changes. If at any time after reviewing or using the App You wish to terminate such use or these Terms, You must uninstall and remove the App from Your Device, and delete any copy in Your possession. This agreement will automatically terminate if You are not, or are no longer, a Verizon subscriber.\n\n**1. THE APP.** The App will allow You to authenticate Your identity to a participating Service Provider (SP). More specifically, the App will allow the SP to verify that certain actions are originating on Your mobile phone. If You register the App with an SP, then when You login to the SP's app or website on Your mobile phone, You will be given a choice to login with ZenKey by Verizon. In addition to providing a convenient way to log in to Your SP's app or website, You may also choose to use the App for additional authorization. For example, if You instruct Your bank to make a money transfer, Your bank may request that You enter Your ZenKey PIN or use fingerprint or other biometric authorization in order to get stronger verification that You, and not a fraudster, are the person requesting the transfer.\n\nWithout prejudice to any other rights that Verizon may have, Verizon reserves the right and sole discretion to change, update, limit, modify, or temporarily cease to provide the App or any part or feature at any time to any user or group of users, without prior notice and for any reason or no reason.\n\nIn the event You or Verizon terminate the Agreement (or if Verizon terminates the App), You must immediately stop using it.\n\n**2. PERSONAL AND ACCOUNT/DEVICE INFORMATION.** Once you download the App, you will create your account by first providing your existing Verizon password. If you don’t already have a password, you can create one (which you will then be able to use to log into your Verizon account). In connection with Your installation and setup of the App, Verizon will request certain personal information about You, which will include Your first and last name, mobile telephone number, zip code, and email. You may be given the option to store additional information. With regard to the personal information requested by Your SP, You will be in control of precisely which data elements will be disclosed to Your SP. For example, You will be asked to approve the sharing of Your personal information, which may include Your name, email, phone number, and zip code, with Your bank, before Verizon shares Your information with Your bank. You will be given the opportunity to turn on or off personal information elements as well before approval. Verizon will only share the personal information that you approved. Your SP may require certain data elements in order to login or perform certain transactions (for example, Your email address), and if You decline to disclose those data elements to Your SP, Your SP may decline to permit You to login or to perform those transactions through the App. Once the information has been disclosed to Your SP, the SP may use your information for other purposes subject to the terms of Your agreement with Your SP and the SP privacy policy.\n\nVerizon also collects account and device information that uniquely identifies Your mobile device and the SIM with which it is associated. In connection with the App services, Verizon may share this account and device information with SPs registered with the App for the purpose of helping verify your Identity and help protect you against fraud, identity theft, and account takeover. With regard to your account and device information, once You register the App with an SP, Your account and device information and any changes to it may be shared with that SP. Information will not be shared by Verizon for any purpose other than providing You with the fraud protection enabled by the App's services. If you no longer want account and device information to be shared with an SP, you must unlink the SP within the App.\n\nAny information disclosed by You to Verizon through the App as well as account and device information used by the App will be maintained in accordance with the App Privacy Statement and Verizon’s privacy policy located at https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/ It is important to note that Verizon may offer other services, such as Verizon’s Identity Verification Services, to protect you from fraud and any action in connection with the App will not affect those other services. Your options with respect to these other programs, such as the Identity Verification Services, can be found in Verizon’s privacy policy.\n\n**3. NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SP SERVICES.** Although We provide the opportunity for You to interface to SPs, You acknowledge that SPs that You connect to Your account or interface with the App and the products and services they provide are not Verizon products, and. Your use of SP services is governed by separate terms of use set by the SPs, including the SP privacy policies. Verizon may review an SP prior to permitting their use of Zenkey and Verizon reserves the right in its sole discretion to restrict or deny access to any SP otherwise accessible through the App. However, Verizon makes no representation or warranty about any SP. Verizon is not responsible for Your use of any SP services or any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to Your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to Your use of any SP Services. You should contact the SP for customer service, repairs, questions or other support regarding the SP Services.\n\n**4. ACCOUNT SECURITY.** You are solely responsible for any use of the App (including any use by anyone to whom You have provided access to Your devices, the App) on any devices. We expressly disclaim any liability for damages You may incur in connection with any unauthorized use. To help reduce the possibility of unauthorized use, We strongly recommend implementing security measures, such as utilizing encryption on Your devices, and using a screen lock or a unique password that others won't easily guess, on any device from which You plan to use the App and/or the Service. Do not record Your ZenKey PIN or ZenKey recovery codes in a place where an unauthorized person can find it.\n\n**5. SOFTWARE.** The App includes software that is owned by us, our affiliates, or third-party licensors (\"Software\"). We may update the Software from time to time and Your failure to install any update may affect Your use of the App and/or use of the Software. You may use the Software only as part of, or for use with, the App, as authorized in these Terms. Subject to these Terms, We grant You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App and the Software solely as authorized under Your data plan and the Customer Agreement.\n\nYou agree to follow all rules and policies applicable to the App, including the installation of required or automated updates, modifications and/or reinstallations of Software and obtaining available patches to address security, interoperability and/or performance issues. Please also see the “Data Services” section of the Verizon Wireless Important Plan Information document located at https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/important-plan-information/ to learn more about permitted and prohibited data uses.\n\nThis License applies only to the functions of the App which consist of Initial Setup of the App, the process by which You register usage of the App with an SP, the process by which You login to Your SP's app, and the process by which You provide any additional authorization to Your SP through the App, and the process by which You manager Your ZenKey account.\n\nZenKey includes third party software subject to open source license terms, a list of which you can view at https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/internet/equipment/open-source-software. Your right to use this software is subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable open source license. If there is a conflict between these Terms and that license, the license terms will control.\n\nAll rights regarding use of the App and Software not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by us and/or any of Verizon’s third-party licensors.\n\n**6. RESTRICTIONS ON USE. **The App is intended for Your personal use only. You may download and use the App only if You can form a binding contract with Verizon and You are not a person who is barred from downloading or using the App by laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.\n\nYou will not and will not allow or help any third party to use the App in any way that violates any applicable rules, laws or regulations or infringes any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right or discloses a trade secret or confidential information. ; You will not and will not allow or help any third party to misuse the App, including, without limitation, using it in any manner that: (a) interferes with or interrupts it or any hardware, software, system or network connected with it; (b) stalks, harasses, threatens or harms any person or is otherwise invasive of another's privacy rights; (c) uses it on a device without permission; (d) tampers with or makes an unauthorized connection to any network, including, without limitation, the network of any wireless carrier; (e) disseminates viruses or other computer code, files or programs that interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of it or any other computer software or hardware.

OWNERSHIP RIGHTS.** You agree that all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights associated with the App are respectively Verizon’s and our third-party licensors’ exclusive property, and all such rights not expressly granted to You herein are reserved and retained by Verizon and our third-party licensor(s), as applicable. If You submit comments or ideas about the App, including ways to improve it or other products or services (\"Ideas\"), You agree that Your submission is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction. It does not place Verizon or Verizon’s third-party licensor(s) under any fiduciary or other obligation, and We are free to use the Ideas without compensation and/or to disclose the Ideas to Verizon’s third-party licensor(s) on a non-confidential basis. You further acknowledge that neither Verizon nor Verizon third-party licensor(s), by acceptance of Your submission, waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Us, or developed by Verizon or Verizon’s third-party licensor(s) employees or obtained from sources other than You.\n\n**8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.** THE APP AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND BY EITHER US, OUR PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, CONTRACTORS, AND AGENTS (TOGETHER, THE \"VERIZON PARTIES\"), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE VERIZON PARTIES AND ANY THIRD PARTY MOBILE APPLICATION STORE OPERATORS FROM WHICH YOU DOWNLOAD THE APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR ANY SECURITY ISSUES THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION GIVEN BY THE VERIZON PARTIES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY HEREUNDER.\n\n**9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE VERIZON PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP, WHETHER OR NOT THE DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA, LOSS, MISUSE OR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PRIVACY, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO RECEIVE OR BACK UP YOUR DATA (OR ARCHIVED DATA) OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE APP.

You will promptly notify Us of any claim related to your use of the App.\n\n**11. GENERAL PROVISIONS**\n\na) All obligations of the parties under these Terms, which, by their nature, would continue beyond the termination of these Terms, including without limitation, those relating to Limitation of Liability (Section 11) and Indemnification (Section 12) shall survive such termination.\n\nb) You may not assign or otherwise transfer these terms or Your rights or obligations under them, in whole or in part, to any other person.

      "content": "# Master Domain Registration Agreement for Verizon Domain Names\n\n1. IN THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT (\"Agreement\"), \"Registrant\", \"you\" and \"your\" refers to the Registrant of each domain name registration, \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refers to Tucows.com Co., and \"Services\" refers to the domain name registration services provided by us as offered through Verizon Online LLC and its affiliates, Verizon Online - Maryland LLC and Verizon Online Pennsylvania Partnership, the Registration Service Provider (\"Verizon\"). Any reference to a \"registry,\" \"Registry\" or \"Registry Operator\" shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain (\"TLD\"). This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us for the Services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth by a registry for that particular registry only.\n\n2. SELECTION OF A DOMAIN NAME. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee that you will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of your application. You represent that, to the best of the your knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the domain name nor the manner in which you intend to use it, infringes upon the legal rights of a third party and further, that the domain name is not being registered for, nor shall it at any time whatsoever be used for, any unlawful purpose. During the period following registration of a domain name and the appointment of active name servers, we may post a stagnant web page and any revenues generated from same shall be for our own account.\n\n3. FEES. As consideration for the Services, you agree to pay Verizon the applicable service(s) fees prior to the effectiveness of a desired domain name registration or any renewal thereof. All fees payable hereunder are non-refundable even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term. As further consideration for the Services, you agree to: (1) provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you as required by the registration process, and (2) maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate. All such information shall be referred to as account information (\"Account Information\"). You represent that the Account Information and all other statements put forth in your application are true, complete and accurate. Both Tucows and each registry reserves the right to terminate your domain name registration if: (i) information provided by you or your agent is false, inaccurate, incomplete, unreliable, misleading or otherwise secretive; or (ii) you have failed to maintain, update and keep your Account Information true, current, complete, accurate and reliable. You acknowledge that a breach of this Section 3 will constitute a material breach of our Agreement, which will entitle either us or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to you.\n\n4. TERM. This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of your domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid for at the time of registration or any renewal thereof. Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease.\n\n5. MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT. You acknowledge that the practice of registering and administering domain names is constantly evolving; therefore, you agree that Tucows may modify this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to comply with its agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or individual, as well as to adjust to changing circumstances. All amendments to this Agreement will be posted on our website. Your continued use of the domain name registered to you will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name registration be cancelled or transferred to a different accredited registrar. You agree that such cancellation or request for transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement.\n\n6. MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. In order to change any of your account information with us, you must use the Account Identifier and Password that you selected when you opened your account with us. You agree to safeguard your Account Identifier and Password from any unauthorized use. In no event shall we be liable for the unauthorized use or misuse of your Account Identifier or Password.\n\n7. NO GUARANTEE. You acknowledge that registration or reservation of your chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation or use of the domain name.\n\n8. DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES. You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by the applicable registry. You agree that in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend your ability to use your domain name or to make modifications to your registration records until (i) Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or (ii) Tucows receives notification by you and the other party contesting your domain that the dispute has been settled. Furthermore, you agree that if you are subject to litigation regarding your registration or use of your domain name, Tucows may deposit control of your registration record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate from us.\n\n9. POLICY. You agree that your registration of the domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by us or a registry in registering the name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.\n\n10. AGENCY. Should you intend to license use of a domain name to a third party you shall nonetheless be the domain name holder of record and are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. You shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name. You represent that you will secure the agreement of any third party to the terms and conditions in this Agreement\n\n11. ANNOUNCEMENTS. We reserve the right to distribute information to you that is pertinent to the quality or operation of our services and those of our service partners. These announcements will be predominately informative in nature and may include notices describing changes, upgrades, new products or other information to add security or to enhance your identity on the Internet.\n\n12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. You agree that our entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Services(s) provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited to the amount you paid for the initial registration of your domain name. Tucows and its directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and third party providers, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use any of the Services or for the cost of procurement of substitute services. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by law. We disclaim any and all loss or liability resulting from, but not limited to: (1) loss or liability resulting from access delays or access interruptions; (2) loss or liability resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3) loss or liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or liability resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account identifier or password; (5) loss or liability resulting from errors, omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or liability resulting from the interruption of your Service. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss of registration and use of your domain name, or for interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind (including lost profits) regardless of the form of action whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n13. INDEMNITY. You agree to release, indemnify, and hold Tucows, its contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates, ICANN, the applicable registries and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney's fees, of third parties arising out of or relating to the registration or use of the domain name registered in your name, whether used by yourself, licensed to a third party or pursuant to the Whois Privacy Service, including without limitation infringement by you or a third party with access to your Account Identifier and Password. You also agree to release, indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Dispute Policy. When we are threatened with suit by a third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify us; your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in the suspension or cancellation of your domain name. This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n14. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP. The person named as Registrant on the Whois shall be the registered name holder. The person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account identifier and password are secured shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. You agree that prior to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person (the \"Transferee\") you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void.\n\n15. RENEWALS AND FORFEITURE. Domain names are registered for a finite period of time. You will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration of your registration inviting you to renew your domain name and specifying the amount of time you have to renew your domain name. In the event that you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, your registration will expire and we may, at our discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it for our own account, delete it or we may sell it to a third party. You acknowledge and agree that your right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration and that any expired domain name may be made available for registration by a third party.\n\nIf you fail to renew your registration, your domain name may cease to resolve and visitors to your site may be redirected to a default page informing them that the site is no longer in service. This parked or default page may feature advertisements posted by us for our own account.\n\nIf we, in our sole discretion, have elected to renew the registration, you will be entitled to a grace period of forty (40) days during which you may re-register the domain name from us. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will apply. During this grace period, we may post a parked page and/or may revise the \"Whois\" registration records to include either our information or that of Verizon.

      "content": "# Robocalls\n\nStay a step ahead of the scammers. Educate yourself on some of the most common frauds and scams.\n\n## What are robocalls or spam calls?\n\nA robocall is short for \"robotic call\" and is defined as a phone call that uses a computerized autodialer. Once the call has been answered, the autodialer either plays a recorded message or connects the call to a live person. Some robocalls use personalized audio messages to simulate an actual personal phone call and may individually address the recipient by name.\n\nSpam calls can be a nuisance and, in many cases, a threat. YouMail, a third-party robocall blocking software company, estimates that more than 50 billion robocalls were made in 2021.\n\n## What are the different types of spam calls or robocalls?\n\nTypes of spam calls or robocall scams include:\n\n- Spoofing calls\n- IRS scams\n- Charity scams\n- Travel scams\n- Customer care scams\n- Loan scams\n- etc.\n\nExample 1: Hi, it's Mia. Important announcement, due to the recent COVID-19 coronavirus, the IRS is extending tax filing deadline and settling past-due tax debt. If you currently owe the IRS more than $10,000 in back owed taxes and need help press 1. If this is a call in error please press 7 to be removed. We can put a stop to wage garnishments, leans, and lower or eliminate the amount you owe.\n\nExample 2: Hello this is an important message regarding your credit card payment. Due to the current epidemic of coronavirus, the cardmember services decided to eliminate your monthly payments and interest rates. Credit card members can now avail monthly payments elimination and lower interest rates. To speak to a representative please press 1.\n\n## Are Robocalls Illegal?\n\nIn the U.S, some robocalls are considered legitimate and are allowed without permission under the FTC’s rules.\n\nHere are some legit robocalls that are allowed and why.\n\n- Informational message robocalls are telling you that your flight has been canceled or reminding you about a medical appointment.\n- Debt collection robocalls are businesses that are legitimately trying to collect a debt and are allowed to use recorded messages to reach you. However, services that attempt to sell you services to reduce your debt are not and are probably scams.\n- Healthcare provider calls are from pharmacies reminding you to refill a prescription.\n- Messages from charities can make these calls themselves. But if a charity hires someone to make robocalls on its behalf, the robocalls can only go to prior donors or members of the charity. They must also include an automated option to let you stop future calls.\n\n## How to identify and avoid spam calls/robocalls.\n\nHere are some tips to identify and avoid spam or fraudulent callers.\n\n-\nDo not respond to calls or texts from unknown numbers or any others that appear suspicious.\n\n-\nNever share your personal or financial information via email, text messages, or over the phone.\n\n-\nBe cautious if you’re being pressured to share any information or make a payment immediately.\n\n-\nScammers often spoof phone numbers to trick you into answering or responding. Remember that government agencies will never call you to ask for personal information or money.\n\n-\nAlways check on a charity (for example, by calling or looking at its actual website) before donating.\n\n-\nIf the caller represents a generic sounding organization such as “HealthCentral 2020”, “Local Air Duct”, “The Government”, or not even bothering to identify their organization, then it is a scam.\n\n-\nIf there is pressure to act now, it is a scam.\n\n-\nRecorded generic calls from marketing agencies or unknown numbers are likely spam calls.\n\n-\nIf the caller claims to know you but does not know your name, it is a scam.\n\n-\nIf the caller claims to represent a preexisting relationship and cannot cite an account number, or otherwise prove they are who they purport to be, it is a scam.\n\n-\nA legitimate business calling one of their clients should already know everything they need about their client. Beyond perhaps verifying a birthdate, the customer should provide no information to the caller.\n\n-\nIf the caller wants money, cash cards, social security numbers, credit card or bank account numbers, shoe size when you are 14 years old, mother’s maiden name, etc, It’s a scam. Legitimate requests for payment can be done via mail.\n\n\nAlso, check out consumer tips from the FCC.gov to stop unwanted robocalls.\n\n## What happens if you answer a spam call?\n\nIf you answer a spam call, it could lead to more spam calls. By picking up the phone you are essentially telling robocallers that your number is active and they could in turn sell your number to other telemarketers. It’s important not to answer calls from unknown numbers. If you do happen to answer such a call, hang up immediately.\n\nHere are some steps to take if you answer a spam call.\n\n- Hang up as soon as you realize it’s a robocall. The less you engage, the better. If you talk or react, the call may be marked as “live,” and you will be subject to more of them.\n- Avoid saying the word “yes” if you can. Many robocalls scams start with a question like “Hello, can you hear me?” to which people may reply “yes” without thinking. They can then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities. So, avoid saying yes where possible.\n- Avoid following the bot’s instructions. Robocalls sometimes prompt you to take action, such as “press 1 to speak to a live representative'' or “press 2 to unsubscribe” and so on. By following instructions, you confirm to the robocallers that you are a potential victim and invite further robocalls. Try to avoid taking action.\n- Report the call to the FTC. You can report robocalls to the Federal Trade Commission at donotcall.gov. By reporting the number which appears on your caller ID, you help the FTC track down the scammers behind the call. The FTC takes the phone numbers you report and releases them to the public each business day. This helps phone carriers and other partners that are working on call-blocking solutions. Reports also help law enforcement identify the people behind illegal calls.\n- Exercise caution. The damage that robocall scams can do is significant. Even if they don’t get your credit card information, they will waste your time. Proceed with caution every time you see an unknown caller ID. If a business is calling you, you can hand up, find their contact number on their website, and call them back to check if the call is legitimate.\n\n## How can Verizon customers report a Robocall?\n\nThe Call Filter app and My Verizon allow wireless customers to report a number as spam.\n\nIf you believe we have mistakenly labeled or blocked a legitimate call, please report it at Spam Feedback Website.\n\n**How to report robocalls?**\n\nIn the U.S, you can report robocalls to the Federal Trade Commission. You can also register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry (bear in mind this will only work for companies that follow the law - scammers won’t care if your number is registered in this way).\n\n## How to block spam calls?\n\nIf you are wondering what to do about robocalls or how to block spam calls, here are some tips for device-specific methods of blocking spam calls.\n\n**How to block robocalls on iPhones?**\n\niPhone iOS devices enable you to prevent specific numbers from contacting you, or, if you prefer, you can forward all calls from unfamiliar contacts directly to voicemail.\n\nTo block a number on your iPhone:\n\n- Go to the iPhone app and tap “Recents”\n- Locate the number you would like to block\n- Tap the blue “i” inside a circle to the right of the number\n- On the next screen, scroll down and tap on “Block this caller”\n- Tap on the option “ Black contact” on the message which pops up\n\nTo make yourself unavailable to all numbers which are not on your Contacts list:\n\n- Go to “Settings” and select the option “Phone”\n- Scroll down\n- Tap the “Silence Unknown Callers” switch, so it displays as green\n\n**How to block robocalls on Android devices?**\n\nThe process to follow to block spam calls on Android is similar to the one you use from iPhone.\n\nTo block a number on your Android device:\n\n- Open the Phone app from the home screen\n- Locate the tab “Recent” and tap on it\n- Find the number you want to block, tap on it, and then tap the “i” in a circle\n- Locate the “Block” button and confirm by hitting “Block” in the pop-up message\n\nTo block unknown numbers on your Android device:\n\n- Open the Phone app from the home screen\n- Locate three dots and tap on them to open a drop-down menu\n- Select “Settings: from the list\n- Tap on “Block Numbers”\n- Toggle the “Block Unknown Callers” switch to green\n\n## What does Verizon offer to block robocalls on landline phones?\n\n**Verizon offers Caller ID and Spam Alerts for home phones.** To help wireline voice customers identify unwanted robocalls, we've added Spam Alerts to your home phone's Caller ID. Your Caller ID will show \"SPAM?\" before any caller's name that has been identified as a possible unsolicited call. You can also register your Fios Digital Voice line with Nomorobo, a free third-party service that identifies known robocallers and telemarketers and stops your phone from ringing.\n\nLearn more about Verizon Calling Features\n\n**We also recommend registering your phone numbers at DoNotCall.gov. **Although this FTC registry won’t spare you from calls from scammers and thieves intent on breaking the law, it should prevent you from receiving “live” telemarketing calls, which are regulated by the federal government but are not illegal. You can also report fraud to __the Federal Trade Commission__.\n\n## What does Verizon offer to block spam calls on mobile phones?\n\n**For wireless customers**, Verizon’s Call Filter can help you avoid unwanted calls. Call Filter blocks potentially fraudulent calls by automatically sending them to voicemail, but you can also block unwanted or nuisance calls with the free Call Filter app or through My Verizon. Upgrade to Call Filter Plus to identify unknown callers by name and customize your spam block list.** For the home**, Fios Digital Voice customers automatically get Spam Alerts for free, which warns of potential fraud calls, and can also opt in for Nomorobo through My Verizon, a free tool used to stop unwanted calls from ringing on your home phone.\n\nThe Call Filter app and My Verizon allow wireless customers to report a number as spam. This information will help us improve our spam detection service.\n\n## What is Verizon doing to prevent spam calls?\n\nRobocallers are not going away anytime soon, but Verizon is committed to stopping robocalls so we offer free tools to our mobile and home customers.\n\n- For mobile, Verizon’s\n__Call Filter__is a free service that screens and autoblocks incoming spam calls based on risk level and the spam filter is set to automatically send potential fraud calls to voicemail. - For the home, Fios Digital Voice customers automatically get\n__Spam Alerts__for free, which warn of potential fraud calls, and can also opt in for Nomorobo through__My Verizon__, a free tool used to stop robocalls from ringing on your home phone.\n\nWhile there may not be a silver bullet that entirely ends these activities, we're fully committed to fighting the scourge of robocalls. Verizon is a founding member of the US Telecom Industry Traceback Group, an industry-led organization that traces back suspicious robocall traffic, stops many illegal robocalls, and helps enforcement agencies catch the bad guys. Because most of the most egregious robocalls originate with service providers that look the other way and accept illegal traffic, Verizon has urged the FCC to establish a \"chain of trust\" between the originating provider and the carrier that terminates the call to the U S. consumer.\n\nWe are signing mobile calls using the industry’s STIR/SHAKEN standard, which helps verify that a call is in fact from the number displayed on the Caller ID and not spoofed. Our Fios Digital Voice customers will now have more confidence that the caller ID information they receive for a verified call is accurate.\n\nVerizon automatically blocks in the network calls that we have determined are highly likely to be illegal based on reasonable analytics that incorporate caller ID authentication information. Verizon also uses STIR/SHAKEN technology to update our spam detection algorithm used by Call Filter, in real-time which may, in some cases, reduce the chances of incorrectly blocking or identifying a “good” call as “Potential Spam.”\n\nThrough the efforts of Verizon and our partners, we are starting to curb the increase in robocalls.\n\n## How is Verizon protecting legitimate calls?\n\nVerizon wants to ensure that its customers receive good and wanted calls. Customers can let us know if we incorrectly identify or block a wanted call as spam. Calling parties can contact us if they believe their calls have been incorrectly blocked or labeled or that they have been adversely affected by information provided by the caller ID authentication framework. Both customers and calling parties can contact us at our Spam Feedback website www.voicespamfeedback.com. And because some robocalls are good, we educate legitimate businesses about “best practices” they can follow to reduce the risks that they get caught in blocking or labeling tools.",

UNLESS THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN AN ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF THE CUSTOMER’S BILLING ADDRESS FOR ANY SUITS OR CAUSES OF ACTION CONNECTED IN ANY WAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TO THE SERVICE.

If Verizon does not resolve an issue to the Customer’s satisfaction, the Customer may request voluntary mediation. Verizon offers customers the option of participating in a free internal mediation program. This program is entirely voluntary and does not affect either party's rights in any other aspect of the dispute resolution procedures outlined in this Agreement. In Verizon’s voluntary mediation program, Verizon will assign an employee who is not directly involved in the dispute to help both sides reach an agreement. That person has all the rights and protections of a mediator and the process has all of the protections associated with mediation. For example, nothing said in the mediation can be used later in an arbitration or lawsuit. If a Customer would like to know more, or would like to start the mediation process, please contact Verizon at NoticeOfDispute@verizon.com or through Verizon Online Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC52N061, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920, for a Notice of Customer Dispute Form. Fill out and send the Notice of Customer Dispute Form to Verizon according to the directions on the form.\n\nARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS.\n\nVERIZON HOPES TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, AND THAT ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT OR VERIZON SERVICE CAN BE RESOLVED THROUGH VERIZON’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH CAN BE REACHED BY CALLING THE NUMBER ON THE CUSTOMER’S BILL OR GOING TO THE “CONTACT US” LINK ON VERIZON’S WEBSITE, HTTP://WWW22.VERIZON.COM/CUSTOMERSUPPORT/CONTACTUS/INDEX/. BUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF BOTH PARTIES. THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. BOTH PARTIES ALSO AGREE IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO.\n\nTHE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES THAT QUALIFY, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES FROM VERIZON (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\") OR BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU (\"BBB\"). THE CUSTOMER CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES HE/SHE MAY HAVE TO THE ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, MAY SEEK RELIEF AGAINST VERIZON ON THE BEHALF OF THE CUSTOMER.\n\nUNLESS THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF THE CUSTOMER’S BILLING ADDRESS. FOR CLAIMS OVER $10,000, THE AAA'S ARBITRATION RULES WILL APPLY; IN SUCH CASES, THE LOSER CAN ASK FOR A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS TO REVIEW THE AWARD. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THE PARTY BRINGING THE CLAIM CAN CHOOSE EITHER THE AAA'S RULES OR THE BBB'S RULES FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CAN BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THE PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG), THE BBB (WWW.BBB.ORG) OR FROM VERIZON. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THET CUSTOMER MAY CHOOSE WHETHER THE\n\nCUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR BY A HEARING IN–PERSON OR BY PHONE.\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA OR BBB PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS PERMISSIBLE. THE ARBITRATOR ALSO SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO PRESIDE OVER CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, OR TO AWARD ANY FORM OF CLASSWIDE OR COLLECTIVE REMEDY. INSTEAD, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE POWER TO AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NO AAA OR BBB RULE WILL APPLY IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION IN THE AAA OR BBB RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE BOUND TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY RELIEF THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SUCH LAWS.\n\nIF EITHER PARTY INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO VERIZON SHOULD BE SENT TO NOTICEOFDISPUTE@VERIZON.COM OR TO VERIZON DISPUTE RESOLUTION MANAGER, ONE VERIZON WAY, VC52N061, BASKING RIDGE, NJ 07920. THE NOTICE MUST DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 30 DAYS, EITHER PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION. VERIZON WILL PAY ANY FILING FEE THAT THE AAA OR BBB CHARGES THE CUSTOMER FOR ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE. IF THE CUSTOMER PROVIDES A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE THAT HE/SHE CANNOT PAY THE FILING FEE, VERIZON WILL PAY THE FEE DIRECTLY TO THE AAA OR BBB. IF THAT ARBITRATION PROCEEDS, VERIZON WILL ALSO PAY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED LATER, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPEAL TO A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS (IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS APPEALABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT).\n\nVERIZON MAY, BUT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE ARBITRATION BEGINS. THE AMOUNT OR TERMS OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL AFTER THE ARBITRATOR ISSUES AN AWARD ON THE CLAIM. IF THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT ACCEPT THE OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS THE CUSTOMER AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS MORE THAN OUR OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5000, OR IF VERIZON DOES NOT MAKE AN OFFER, AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS THE CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT LESS THAN $5000, THEN VERIZON AGREES TO PAY YOU $5000 INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE VERIZON ALSO AGREES TO PAY ANY REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW REQUIRES IT FOR THE CASE. IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS THE CUSTOMER MORE THAN $5000, THEN WE WILL PAY THAT AMOUNT TO THE CUSTOMER.\n\nAN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CANNOT BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.\n\nIF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.\n\nIF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. THE CUSTOMER AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nIn the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain such invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\nVerizon shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations if such delay or non-performance arises in connection with any acts of God, fires, floods, strikes, or other labor disputes, unusually severe weather, acts of any governmental body, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Verizon.\n\nENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\nThese Terms and Conditions constitute the complete and exclusive terms and conditions pursuant to which Verizon provides inside wire maintenance services to you; there are no other agreements, oral or written, relating to these services.",

      "content": "# Binding Corporate Rules\n\nVerizon maintains a list of the participants of its Binding Corporate Rules and their contacts details.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Binding Corporate Rules Processor and Controller Policies establish the approach taken by Verizon Business Group (“Verizon”) to the protection and management of personal information, in accordance with the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, when it is transferred from the EU or UK to a third country.\n\nThe lead supervisory authority for Verizon's EU Binding Corporate Rules is the Irish Data Protection Commission. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is the supervisory authority for Verizon's UK Binding Corporate Rules.\n\n## International Transfers under BCRs\n\nGuidelines from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) require companies to assess whether transfers of personal data out of the EU are adequately protected in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation and to put in place such additional safeguards they consider necessary. Since then, the US administration has made certain changes to rules around US intelligence-gathering, primarily to support the EU/US Privacy Framework, and as a result international transfers to the US under Verizon’s Binding Corporate Rules and other adequacy mechanisms now benefit from those safeguards, which are contained in Executive Order 14086.\n\nFollowing the EDPB guidelines, Verizon has reviewed its Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) and the transfers of personal data that are made under the protection of the BCRs. Verizon evaluates whether additional safeguards are required to protect the personal data when it is transferred out of the EU and UK under the BCRs by assessing the legal regimes in the countries to which it transfers personal data and by completing transfer impact assessments to quantify the risks of such transfers. Appropriate steps, such as additional safeguards set out by the EDPB or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), will be taken to minimize any identified risks.\n\nVerizon’s EU BCRs are reviewed annually by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) as part of the established review cycle. Verizon has acted on guidance from the DPC on changes to Verizon's EU BCRs to take account of the EDPB guidelines and the DPC has approved Verizon's updated EU BCRs, available below. In its role as the lead supervisory authority for Verizon’s EU BCRs, the DPC acts on behalf of the EU data protection authorities.\n\nVerizon has obtained approval from the ICO to use UK Binding Corporate Rules for Controllers and Binding Corporate Rules for Processors, which are formed using the UK Addendum to the EU Binding Corporate Rules. The UK Binding Corporate Rules ensure the adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred out of the UK.\n\nVerizon is satisfied that the BCRs meet the current requirements.\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules Processor Policy\n\nThe Binding Corporate Rules Processor Policies (“Policies”) establish the approach taken by Verizon to the protection and management of personal information1 globally when Verizon group members (\"Group Members\") process2 that information on behalf of a third party or another Group Member, and where such personal information originates from Europe (including the EEA and Switzerland) or the UK, except where your contract states otherwise.\n\nThe Policies are an appropriate safeguard, or adequacy mechanism, as set out in GDPR Article 46. They apply to all personal information originating from Europe and the UK when it is collected and processed as part of the regular business activities of Verizon in the course of providing services to a third party or to another Group Member (equally referred to as the \"customer\" in the Policies). Group Members and their employees must comply with and respect the Policies when collecting and processing personal information in their capacity as service providers.\n\nVerizon has adopted UK Binding Corporate Rules formed using the UK Addendum to EU Binding Corporate Rules, and therefore transfers of UK-originating personal data are protected to the same standards as set out in Policies.The Policies do not replace any specific data protection requirements that might apply to a business area or function.\n\nDownload the UK Binding Corporate Rules Processor Summary (PDF)\n\nDownload the Full EU Binding Corporate Rules Processor Policy (PDF)\n\n1 Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person in line with the definition of “personal data” in EU Regulation 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.\n\n2 For the purposes of this Policy reference to the 'processing' of personal information is as defined in EU Regulation 2016/679 GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and references to 'collection' 'use' and 'transfer' are all elements of the definition of processing.\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy\n\nThe Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policies (“Policies”) establish the approach taken by Verizon to the protection and management of personal information1 globally by Verizon group members (\"Group Members\") when processing2 that information for their own purposes and where such personal information originates from Europe (including the EEA and Switzerland) or the UK.\n\nThe Policies are an appropriate safeguard, or adequacy mechanism, as set out in GDPR Article 46. They apply to all personal information that is processed in Europe and the UK (which means that it will also include personal information collected by Group Members outside Europe and sent to Group Members in Europe and the UK ) which is then transferred from Group Members within Europe and the UK to Group Members outside Europe. Group Members and their employees must comply with and respect the Policies when collecting and processing personal information for Verizon’s own purposes. The Policies apply to all such personal information processed by Verizon, for example (i) in the course of customer and supplier management, and (ii) which relates to employees and contractors.\n\nVerizon has adopted UK Binding Corporate Rules formed using the UK Addendum to EU Binding Corporate Rules, and therefore transfers of UK-originating personal data are protected to the same standards as set out in Policies. The Policies do not replace any specific data protection requirements that might apply to a business area or function.\n\nDownload the full EU Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy (PDF)\n\nDownload the UK Binding Corporate Rules Controller Summary (PDF)\n\n1 Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person in line with the definition of “personal data” in EU regulation 2016/679 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.\n\n2 For the purposes of this Policy reference to the 'processing' of personal information is as defined in EU Regulation 2016/279 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and references to 'collection' 'use' and 'transfer' are all elements of the definition of processing.\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules Participant List\n\nBelow is a list of companies which are participants of Verizon’s EU Binding Corporate Rules and Verizon's UK Binding Corporate Rules, including contact details for those companies.

      "content": "# Verizon Fios Prepaid Terms of Service\n\nThanks for choosing Verizon Prepaid Services. The Fios Internet, Fios TV, and/or Home Phone (a prepaid Fios Digital Voice service) services that you purchase (the “Services”) on a prepaid basis are subject to their Individual Terms of Service (“Service Terms”), which can be found at verizon.com/terms, and to this agreement (the “Agreement”), which explains differences in how you maintain and pay for your Services. Home Phone service is governed by the Fios Digital Voice Terms of Service. The Service Terms and this Agreement are between you and the Verizon affiliate(s) named in the Service Terms.\n\nThe Agreement and the Service Terms contain important information about your Services, including our ability to make changes to your Services and that any disputes between us must be resolved in arbitration or small claims court.\n\n1. Acceptance. You may accept this Agreement by agreeing in writing, during an online order or online acceptance process over the phone, in person or by your use of the Service(s) or any equipment we provide. You must also accept the Service Terms for each of your Service(s). When you accept, you're representing that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and are legally able to accept an agreement.\n\n2. Terms and Conditions. Your Services are subject to this Agreement, the applicable Service Terms, the specific elements of your Services (including the pricing, duration, content, usage, and/or speed) described in the information made available to you when placing and confirming your order, our Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, Website Terms of Use, as well as the other Policies and Materials referenced in the Service Terms, all of which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. A current version of this Agreement, the Service Terms and other Policies can be found at verizon.com/terms. In the event of a conflict between the Service Terms and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will control except as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement.\n\n3. Changes to this Agreement. We can change our prices, fees, any of the Services, Service Terms or this Agreement, including changes to payment terms, programming packages, Service features or speeds, and any equipment provided. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or our Service Terms, any such changes will be effective 10 days after they are posted at verizon.com/announcements or after notice is provided to you pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement.\n\n4. Term / Cancellation. Prepaid Services are offered on a month-to-month basis only, pursuant to a trial, which may be discontinued by us at any time with thirty (30) days advance notice to you. In the event Services are no longer offered on a prepaid basis, you must comply with any applicable credit, deposit, payment or other requirements within the time period specified in the notice in order to continue receiving the Services. You will not receive a refund of any amounts that are prepaid if you cancel your Services before the end of the current month. Equipment must be returned to us upon account closure in accordance with the Service Terms.\n\n5. Charges and Payment Terms.\n\na. Prepaid Charges. You agree to pay for the Services on a prepaid basis for a minimum period of one month. You should not prepay for more than one month at a time. You are also responsible for paying all applicable taxes, surcharges, fees or other charges associated with the Services. Payment for the initial month of Services must be paid in full before we will ship equipment or schedule an installation date. You agree to pay any installation or other additional fees prior to the time of installation, at the time of installation, or after installation if paying by cash, but at all times prior to activation of the Services. Customers paying with cash may pay for certain repair charges with the next monthly renewal payment.\n\nb. Service Period -- Payments.\n\ni. Payment Cycle. Your monthly payment cycle will begin on the date your (a) Services are installed and activated if Verizon is installing your Services or (b) on the date the Equipment is delivered to you if you are self-installing the Service. Your Services will be available for one month after activation. You must pay for the next month’s Services before the expiration of the current month (the “Expiration Date”) to keep your Services active. Services are renewed for the next month when we receive payment in full.\n\nii. Non-Renewal. If you do not pay for the next month’s Services prior to the Expiration Date, your Services will be no longer be available, without additional notice to you. You may restore your Services by paying for an additional month, and the date your services are reactivated will begin a new month of Service. While your Services are unavailable, you may not make any equipment changes and you will not be charged for Services. Your Services will be restored within 24 hours of our receipt of your payment. There is no fee to restore Services.\n\niii. Account Closure. If you do not make a payment for three consecutive months, your Verizon account will be closed and you must return any Verizon-provided equipment to Verizon in accordance with the applicable Service Terms. You must order as a new customer if you wish to purchase prepaid Services after account closure.\n\nc. Third Party Charges. You are solely responsible for any charges you may incur with third-party service providers, including accessing on-line services or subscriptions.\n\nd. Payment Methods. You may be required to utilize a credit or debit card to prepay your initial month of Service. Subsequent payments may be made by credit or debit cards, by cash at an authorized payment location or such other payment methods as we may designate. If you use a credit or debit card to pay for the Services, your use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement. If we receive a chargeback through your credit or debit card, your Services will be automatically unavailable. More than one chargeback in a six month period will result in closure of your account. If you are a cash customer, we may send you an email with your account number to use in processing your payment; the number may also be used to authenticate your Verizon account, and you acknowledge the unencrypted email may increase risk of interception by a third party.\n\ne. Refunds. We will not refund any amounts prepaid for the Services, subject to applicable law, unless an order is cancelled prior to installation or activation.\n\nf. Account Statements. Your Account Statement will be provided online and will be available to you through your My Verizon Account; paper statements are not available.\n\n6. Service Information.\n\na. Service Availability. Not all Verizon Services will be available in all areas. You may not move your Verizon Services or temporarily discontinue your prepaid Verizon Services within the current month, and no refunds will be given for amounts that have been prepaid. Services may be re-established at a new location as a new account. Only designated Service options, including available Fios Internet Speeds and Fios TV packages, will be available as prepaid Services.\n\nService Limitations. You may order up to three additional Set Top Boxes with Fios TV Service for an additional monthly charge. Prepaid Fios TV Service will not include any Video On Demand or Pay Per View options that require a separate payment or monthly charge. Home Phone is a prepaid Fios Digital Voice service governed by the Fios Digital Voice Terms of Service, and will not permit calls that are billed on a usage basis, the purchase of additional lines, directory listings, calls to directory assistance or operator completed calls except by customers with disabilities who register to make such calls, vanity numbers, or pick your own area code numbers. Home Phone telephone numbers will not be listed or published. Vacation suspend will not be available for any Prepaid services.\n\n7. Customer Information. You must provide valid information to us when ordering the Services, including your legal name, service address and email address. You agree to notify us promptly of any changes to this information.\n\n8. General Provisions.\n\na. Certain of our obligations will continue beyond the termination of this Agreement, including those relating to Limitations of Liability, Indemnification, and Arbitration.\n\nb. We are not liable for delays, damages or failures in performance due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a governmental body, acts of God, acts of third parties, fires, floods, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity, or an inability to obtain necessary equipment or services.\n\nc. You may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement in any way to any other person. We may freely assign all or any part of this Agreement with or without notice and you agree to make all subsequent payments as directed.\n\nd. Except as otherwise required by law, you and Verizon agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and the substantive laws of the state of the customer’s service address, without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, will be applied to govern, construe and enforce all of the rights and duties of the parties arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement. UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, YOU AND VERIZON CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN AN ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF THE CUSTOMER’S SERVICE ADDRESS FOR ANY SUITS OR CAUSES OF ACTION CONNECTED IN ANY WAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TO THE SERVICE. Except as otherwise required by law, including state laws relating to consumer transactions, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Service must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is barred.\n\ne. Our failure to insist upon strict compliance with any part of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such terms in the future. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the unenforceable portion shall be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties.\n\n9. Notices. If either of us intends to seek arbitration under this Agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Verizon should be sent to NoticeofDispute@verizon.com or to Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920. A copy of the Notice of Dispute form can be obtained from NoticeofDispute@verizon.com or from the Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, and can also be found at www.verizon.com/terms/disputes. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. Other notices required under this Agreement by you must be provided to us in the manner set forth in the Contact Us section of verizon.com. Notice by us to you, including notice of changes to this Agreement, shall be deemed given upon the earliest of when: (a) transmitted to the email address you have provided; (b) posted at verizon.com/announcements; or (c) included in your monthly account statement available through your online account.\n\n10. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations of Liability. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ABOUT YOUR PREPAID SERVICES OR ANY EQUIPMENT PROVIDED TO YOU BY VERIZON. YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO LIMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR DAMAGES OR OTHER MONETARY RELIEF TO DIRECT DAMAGES. This limitation and waiver will apply regardless of the theory of liability. That means neither of us will try to get any indirect, special, consequential, treble or punitive damages from the other. This limitation and waiver also applies if you bring a claim against one of our suppliers, to the extent we would be required to indemnify the supplier for the claim. Your Services and any equipment we provide are subject to all Disclaimers of Warranties, Indemnification and Limitations of Liability provisions contained in the Service Terms, and those provisions in the Service Terms will control in the event of a dispute between this Agreement and the Service Terms.\n\n11. Voluntary Mediation. We offer customers the option of participating in a free internal mediation program. This program is entirely voluntary and does not affect either party's rights in any other aspect of the dispute resolution procedures outlined in Section 12. In our voluntary mediation program, we will assign an employee who is not directly involved in the dispute to help both sides reach an agreement. That person has all the rights and protections of a mediator and the process has all of the protections associated with mediation. For example, nothing said in the mediation can be used later in an arbitration or lawsuit. If you would like to know more, or you would like to start the mediation process, please contact us at NoticeofDispute@verizon.com or through the Verizon Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920, for a notice of customer dispute form. A copy of the Notice of Dispute form can also be found at www.verizon.com/terms/disputes. Fill out and send the Notice of Dispute Form to us according to the directions on the form.\n\n12. ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS. WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, BUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF BOTH OF US. YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:\n\na. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES THAT QUALIFY, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\"). YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU (“BBB”), ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US FOR YOU.\n\nb. UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR SERVICE ADDRESS. FOR CLAIMS OVER $10,000, THE AAA'S ARBITRATION RULES WILL APPLY; IN SUCH CASES, THE LOSER CAN ASK FOR A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS TO REVIEW THE AWARD. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THE PARTY BRINGING THE CLAIM CAN CHOOSE THE AAA'S RULES FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CAN BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU CAN GET PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION FROM THE AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG), OR FROM US. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR BY A HEARING IN–PERSON OR BY PHONE.\n\nc. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS PERMISSIBLE. THE ARBITRATOR ALSO SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO PRESIDE OVER CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, OR TO AWARD ANY FORM OF CLASSWIDE OR COLLECTIVE REMEDY. INSTEAD, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE POWER TO AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NO AAA RULE WILL APPLY IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION IN THE AAA OR BBB RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE BOUND TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY RELIEF THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SUCH LAWS.\n\nd. IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO VERIZON SHOULD BE SENT TO NOTICEOFDISPUTE@VERIZON.COM OR TO VERIZON DISPUTE RESOLUTION MANAGER, ONE VERIZON WAY, VC54N090, BASKING RIDGE, NJ 07920. THE NOTICE MUST DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 30 DAYS, EITHER PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION. VERIZON WILL PAY ANY FILING FEE THAT THE AAA CHARGES YOU FOR ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE. IF YOU PROVIDE US WITH SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE THAT YOU CANNOT PAY THE FILING FEE, VERIZON WILL PAY THE FEE DIRECTLY TO THE AAA. IF THAT ARBITRATION PROCEEDS, WE'LL ALSO PAY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED LATER, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPEAL TO A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS (IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS APPEALABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT).\n\ne. WE MAY, BUT ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE THE ARBITRATION EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEGINS (OR, IF THERE IS NO EVIDENTIARY HEARING, BEFORE THE PARTIES COMPLETE SUBMISSION OF THEIR EVIDENCE TO THE ARBITRATOR). THE AMOUNT OR TERMS OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL AFTER THE ARBITRATOR ISSUES AN AWARD ON THE CLAIM. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS MORE THAN OUR OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5000, OR IF WE DO NOT MAKE YOU AN OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT LESS THAN $5000, THEN WE AGREE TO PAY YOU $5000 INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE WE ALSO AGREE TO PAY ANY REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW REQUIRES IT FOR YOUR CASE. IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU MORE THAN $5000, THEN WE WILL PAY YOU THE AMOUNT AWARDED.\n\nf. AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THATSPECIFIC CASE; IT CANNOT BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARDITSELF.\n\ng. IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION16(c) CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.\n\nh. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION,YOU AND VERIZON AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND VERIZONUNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING ORCOUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THEEVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO ATRIAL BY THE COURT.\n\nv.17-1\n\nEffective Date: September 12, 2017",

Zákony o ochraně osobních údajů na celém světě vyžadují, aby vám společnost Verizon poskytla určité informace týkající se shromažďování vašich osobních údajů. Kromě těchto obecných zásad můžete obdržet další informace o tom, jak používáme vaše osobní údaje na základě vaší komunikace s námi.\n\n#### 2. Jaké typy osobních údajů společnost Verizon shromažďuje?\n\nSpolečnost Verizon shromažďuje osobní údaje o svých zákaznících a jejich zaměstnancích, uchazečích, koncových uživatelích, dodavatelích, návštěvnících webových stránek, uživatelích aplikací a uchazečích o zaměstnání.

      "content": "# \"It sparked a fire inside of me.\"\n\nVerizon employees show middle school boys the path to a brighter future.\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“The students know about the technology, but they don’t know how to get into it.”\n\n“Do you guys recognize what these are?” asked **Kevin Johnson, an assistant performance engineer at Verizon**, pointing to a line of spire-shaped antennas on a computer screen.\n\n“Cell phone towers,” answered one of the boys standing in front of his demo table. “They provide internet.”\n\nThen came the bigger challenge: Could anyone explain how cell phone signals work? Hands shot up. Johnson was prodding the students to see if they understood how Pythagoras' theorem translates to the real world and also how their STEM learnings can transfer to a great career.\n\nOn a sunny Saturday morning, more than 60 middle school students packed into a conference room at Baltimore’s Morgan State University. They were there for the Verizon Innovative Learning Career Day, where Verizon employees shared their experience about what’s needed to start a technology career.\n\nSince 2012, Verizon Innovative Learning has provided free technology, free internet access, and hands-on learning experiences to help give over a million students the education they deserve.\n\nFor the boys at Morgan State University, this day was part of a two-year curriculum that teaches students coding, robotics, 3D design and other STEM skills to help prepare them for college and a career.\n\nThe program curriculum impacts the boys in numerous ways: improving their schoolwork, upping their grades, and focusing their future career goals. In a recent survey, 90 percent of the students in the program reported an increase in their math and science skills.\n\nKevin Johnson’s cell tower presentation was just one of several hands-on demonstrations Verizon employees created for the students. In it, he handed the boys smartphones loaded with an augmented reality app to demonstrate how the technology may be used in the future to assist repair engineers working in the field on cell phone towers or relay systems.\n\n“The knowledge has to be put out there,” said **Verizon Security Network Engineer Tracy Barwick,** who also presented at the event. “The students know about the technology, but they don’t know how to get into it. When we do these innovative learning events, it shows some of the opportunities out there and how we open the doors for them.”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the students and employees who came together and inspired each other on Career Day. ♦\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“I want to design my own planes and test them out. This program helped me believe I can do it.”\n\n**Keon Jones** had never seen an AR application like the one Johnson shared at the presentation and he marveled over the realistic 3D rendering. His mentors say his attitude has changed a lot between the time he started Verizon Innovative Learning two years ago and now. Early on, the classes made him nervous.\n\n“It was confusing and out of my comfort zone,” he admitted. With the help of the mentors and teachers he’s grown accustomed to the program and realizes it has helped him in school.\n\n“At first, whenever we had computer classes in school I wasn’t the greatest at them. Once I started coming here, I learned about designing apps. I went back to school and they were soon doing the same thing. It was way easier and I didn’t have to constantly raise my hand for help.”\n\nKeon recently flew for the first time and the trip left him fascinated with planes. His eyes and voice filled with wonder as he described visiting the cockpit and seeing all the gauges and meters that tracked the flight path. Keon now hopes to become an aeronautical engineer or marine biologist. “I want to design my own planes and test them out. This program helped me believe I can do it.” ♦\n\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“It shows our future potential leaders the importance of technology and how it plays a part in their development.”\n\nStudents crowded around **Kareem Jackson’s** Career Day station to take turns using the Oculus virtual reality headset. A** Verizon Retail Solutions Manager**, Jackson had brought the gadget knowing it would get students revved up to talk tech. A young teen with dreadlocks watched a 360-degree movie of a roller coaster ride yelling, “Oh my god!” and “Why does it look so real?”\n\nJackson asked the young STEM scholars about what they wanted to do for a living.\n\n“I want to be a pro point guard,” said one.\n\n\nJackson told him to continue playing while also encouraging him to “make sure you’re on point with your mathematics as well.”\n\nAs the father of a teen boy, it’s a conversation Jackson has had many times. His son played sports growing up and occasionally the two spoke about the long odds of being a professional athlete and the longer odds of a sustained career in the NBA or NFL. His advice about studying technology sunk in. The younger Jackson is now 18 and a cybersecurity major in college.\n\nLike his conversations with his son, being a part of Career Day was important to Jackson because it shows “our future potential leaders the importance of technology and how it plays a part in their development.” ♦\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“It sparked a fire inside of me.”\n\n**Ryan Butler** has long been a big fan of technology like race cars and video games, but he wasn’t sure if Verizon Innovative Learning was right for him. When he started the program two years ago, his instructors remember he groaned about almost everything, regularly saying things like, “I don’t feel like being here right now.”\n\nThen the 3D printing class happened. “It sparked a fire inside of me,” he enthused. “I just like that you can create anything.”\n\nThe possibilities get him fired up. Ryan now spends part of his spare time designing a 3D-printed pirate ship, a project that was inspired by his work with Verizon Innovative Learning.\n\nThe program also helped change his career vision. “Going here influenced me to become an electrical engineer,” he explained. He was interested to hear on Career Day that Verizon hires pilots. “Now I know about this big huge world of technology and I want to learn more about it.” ♦\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“I’m more positive. I want to learn these kinds of things.\"\n\n**Aram Hayrapetyan** foresees math and technology being a part of any career he chooses. He loves working with technology so much that when a Verizon Innovative Learning program leader asked the students to program an app, he coded five. After the program taught him about drones, his passion for them skyrocketed. He now owns four.\n\nAram and fellow student **Elijah Skinner** developed an application that will help first responders track someone during a disaster as long as the imperiled person has his or her cell phone on. “Once you open the application, it sends your location to your phone service so a first responder can find you,” explained **Verizon Innovative Learning instructor Kelechi Nwachukwu**. “The idea has stuck with me. I hope to work with them again and bring it to market.”\n\nKevin Johnson’s presentation about cell phone towers made Aram interested to learn more about how they work.\n\nHe hopes to become a pilot or businessman one day, so he was excited to hear at Career Day that Verizon has an aeronautical branch.\n\nSince starting the program in 2016, the Verizon Innovative Learning projects have “definitely” influenced Aram’s schoolwork, particularly with computers.\n\n“I’m more positive. I want to learn these kinds of things. In school I’m paying more attention to see if I can connect what I learned here to what I can learn there. When I find those connections, I tell my teachers and they’re impressed.” ♦\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“As technology changes, I want to be a part of the change.”\n\n**Kevin Johnson** first became interested in technology — ham radios — when he was young, and his enthusiasm for computers and new gadgets still shows. He smiles like a proud professor recalling how the students interacted with the augmented reality app that was part of his presentation — and he learned something new from their investigation of it.\n\nCreated by the Harvard Business Review for the article “Why Every Organization Needs an Augmented Reality Strategy” the app deploys digital pop-ups to explain how connected machinery functions.\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“I didn’t realize that if you hold the phone close to the page, the app helps you look inside of the modules on the page,” said Johnson. The students uncovered the functionality while exploring the app’s close-up view. “It was quite eye-opening.”\n\nPart of the reason Jackson wanted to use an augmented reality app in his presentation was to demonstrate how the technology may be used by engineers in the future. For example, a technician working in the field may wear smart glasses that are able to instruct the wearer how to fix a broken module. He also wanted to share his zeal for robotics and computers with the students.\n\n“As technology changes,” he said, “I want to be a part of the change.” ♦\n\n(Photo Credit: Anthony Jordon Jr.)\n\n“Career Day has a longstanding impact.”\n\n“Maryland’s cutbacks in education mean there are few enhancement programs like Verizon Innovative Learning, particularly for an under-resourced minority community. But programs like this are important and help shepherd a new generation of students toward STEM careers,” said **LaDawn Partlow, Program Director for Verizon Innovative Learning** at Morgan State University. Since launching the program a few years ago, several of the boys have gone on to high schools with rigorous engineering programs.\n\n“The boys can actually see themselves in the individuals who participate,” she explained about Career Day.\n\n“They may have it in their minds what they want to do, but because they don’t see people like themselves in those positions, they don’t think it’s something they can reach. When they have this opportunity to see people who look like them in positions that they’ve dreamed about being in, then it clicks for them.” ♦",

      "content": "#### 1. Introdução\n\nO objetivo desta política é explicar como as empresas da Verizon localizadas fora dos Estados Unidos (que serão chamadas coletivamente nesta política de “Verizon”, “nós”, “nosso”, ou “nos”) coletam e usam seus dados pessoais. As leis de privacidade ao redor do mundo exigem que a Verizon forneça determinadas informações a você, relacionadas à nossa coleta de dados pessoais. Além desta política geral, é provável que você receba informações adicionais sobre como nós usamos seus dados pessoais com base na sua interação conosco.\n\n#### 2. Quais tipos de dados pessoais a Verizon coleta?\n\nA Verizon coleta dados pessoais de clientes e respectivos funcionários, requerentes, usuários finais, fornecedores, visitantes de seus sites, usuários de aplicativos e candidatos a emprego. Os dados pessoais coletados podem incluir: nome, endereço, número de telefone (fixo e/ou celular), endereço de e-mail, o nome da sua empresa ou empregador, nomes de contato específicos e cargos, números de fax, endereços IP, informações de identificação e localização de dispositivos, informações de uso de serviços e sites, informações de faturamento e negociações e informações de cartão de crédito e outras informações financeiras. A natureza das informações que nós coletamos dependerá, por exemplo, dos serviços que estão sendo solicitados ou promovidos. Com relação a clientes que usam nossos serviços de telemática, coletamos também informações sobre veículo e direção. Por exemplo, localização e velocidade.\n\n#### 3. Como a Verizon obtém dados pessoais?\n\nA Verizon pode obter dados pessoais de inúmeras formas, como de pedidos realizados por clientes e usuários finais (seja por telefone, fax ou e-mail, pela internet ou por formulário de inscrição, formulário de pedido ou contrato), de produtos e serviços, de portais e aplicativos, de indagações feitas por clientes existentes e em potencial e de fornecedores, contratados ou candidatos.\n\nA Verizon pode usar \"cookies\" e tecnologia semelhante para obter informações sobre os visitantes de nossos sites ou as respostas que você envia aos nossos e-mails. Cookies são pequenos arquivos de texto armazenados na memória e no disco rígido do seu computador ou seu dispositivo móvel. Cookies são usados para permitir que nossos sites funcionem ou podem fornecer informações para terceiros. Essas informações podem ser sobre você, suas preferências ou seu dispositivo. As informações não identificam você diretamente, mas podem lhe oferecer uma experiência mais personalizada. Especificamente, cookies (a) nos ajudam a melhorar a qualidade e a utilidade de nossos sites e determinar que partes dos nossos sites ou e-mails são do seu interesse, (b) identificam suas preferências de tecnologia, incluindo armazenamento e reconhecimento das suas configurações e dos seus atributos de usuário, (c) facilitam a navegação, e (d) personalizam sua experiência. O uso de cookies também pode nos permitir automatizar a entrada em partes de nossos sites protegidas por senha, para que assim você não precise digitar novamente sua senha toda vez em que visitar esse site.\n\nA seguir está uma lista dos tipos de cookies que nós usamos e suas opções relacionadas a eles:\n\nCookies essenciais permitem que nós forneçamos o serviço que você solicitou e nos ajudam a manter o site e seus recursos protegidos e seguros. Desabilitar esses cookies pode afetar a funcionalidade do site. Você não pode optar por retirar seu consentimento aos cookies essenciais.\n\nCookies de preferências de uso são ativados quando você faz determinadas escolhas em nossos sites e memorizam senhas e preferências de configurações, permitindo adaptar a experiência que fornecemos para você. Você pode optar por participar e retirar seu consentimento a esses cookies.\n\nCookies analíticos nos permitem reconhecer e mensurar seu uso dos nossos sites, compilar um registro dessas informações de uso, e nos ajudam a melhorar e desenvolver a maneira como nossos sites operam. Nossos sites usam cookies do Google Analytics para ajudar a analisar como os usuários usam nossos sites. As informações geradas pelo cookie normalmente serão armazenadas em um servidor do Google nos EUA. No entanto, se você estiver localizado na União Europeia (UE) ou no Espaço Econômico Europeu (EEE), seu endereço IP será encurtado antecipadamente pelo Google. Somente em casos excepcionais, seu endereço completo será transmitido para um servidor do Google nos EUA e encurtado lá. Em nome da Verizon, o Google usará essas informações com o propósito de compilar relatórios sobre a atividade dos sites. O endereço IP transmitido do seu navegador como parte do Google Analytics não será associado a qualquer outro dado retido pelo Google. Você poderá evitar que os dados de uso da rede sejam transmitidos para o Google ao fazer download e instalar um plug-in do navegador. Você pode optar por participar e retirar seu consentimento a esses cookies.\n\nCookies de publicidade comportamental publicados por nós e por terceiros permitem o monitoramento do seu comportamento em determinados sites. Essas informações são usadas para (a) fornecer uma experiência personalizada por meio de publicidade em alguns de nossos sites ou por meio de publicidade em sites de terceiros, ou (b) monitorar a efetividade das nossas campanhas de marketing digital. Você pode optar por participar e retirar seu consentimento aos cookies de publicidade. Nós usamos parceiros de publicidade, incluindo a Oath, que devem aderir às orientações de Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (Princípios de boa prática para publicidade comportamental online) da European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance e Internet Advertising Bureau UK. Você pode saber mais e optar por não participar da publicidade comportamental acessando o site do Internet Advertising Bureau.\n\n\nDependendo do propósito, alguns cookies operarão somente durante uma única sessão de navegação, enquanto outros operarão por mais tempo para funcionarem como pretendido. Você tem a opção de excluir ou bloquear esses cookies por meio de um navegador de internet ou outro software disponível comercialmente. Entretanto, isso pode tornar indisponíveis alguns dos recursos de nossos sites e esses controles podem não funcionar com algumas tecnologias.\n\nOs e-mails que enviamos a você podem incluir web beacons que usamos para determinar o número de pessoas que abrem ou clicam nos links em nossos e-mails. Se você não quiser permitir web beacons no e-mail que receber, poderá desativar as imagens HTML ou recusar HTML (selecionar somente texto) em seu software de e-mail.\n\nPodemos obter informações sobre você, coletadas em conferências, encontros e seminários. Podemos também coletar informações por meio de salas de bate-papo, publicações em blog, grupos de discussão e sites de rede social. Essas informações que nos possibilitam acessar os sites de rede social variam de acordo com o site e são afetadas pelas configurações de privacidade que você introduz em cada um deles.\n\nA Verizon também obtém dados de terceiros. Por exemplo, a Verizon pode obter informações financeiras fornecidas por terceiros sobre clientes e usuários finais para poder avaliar seus riscos na concessão de condições de crédito e pode ainda comprar informações de contato relacionadas a organizações que talvez tenham interesse por nossos produtos e serviços.\n\n#### 4. Como a Verizon usa os dados pessoais coletados?\n\nA Verizon usa seus dados pessoais para diversos propósitos, incluindo fornecimento dos nossos serviços, habilitação de sua conta, faturamento, suporte técnico, desenvolvimento de produtos e solicitação de pagamento. Com relação aos clientes de telemática, a Verizon pode vincular dados de veículo e direção a dados pessoais. Além disso, a Verizon usa dados pessoais para aprimorar os serviços que a empresa oferece aos seus clientes e para combater fraudes e outras atividades ilegais.\n\nTambém podemos usar seus dados pessoais para entrar em contato com você a respeito de nossos produtos e serviços, e isso inclui solicitações para participação em pesquisa. Nós usaremos seus dados pessoais para finalidades de marketing ou outros propósitos não relacionados ao seu serviço específico quando isso estiver de acordo com a lei aplicável de proteção de dados e privacidade e com qualquer preferência que você expressar.\n\nAo usar sites e aplicativos da Verizon, são coletadas informações sobre seu dispositivo e sua visita, como datas, horários e duração dessas visitas a nossos sites (inclusive se você é um novo visitante ou um visitante recorrente); atividades de navegação, pesquisa e compra quando você interage com nossos sites e aplicativos; endereço IP; número de celular; endereços dos sites dos quais você provém e para os quais se dirige – por exemplo, se visitou o site diretamente ou foi encaminhado por outro site ou link; bem como informações de localização consistentes com as configurações de seu navegador e escolha de aplicativos e informações sobre sua conexão, como o navegador, o sistema operacional e o tipo de plataforma de seu dispositivo. Usamos essas informações para finalidades operacionais, de medição de desempenho e outras finalidades comerciais, assim como para ajudar a veicular mensagens de marketing da Verizon mais relevantes em nossos sites e em sites que não são da Verizon. As mensagens de marketing podem ser entregues por meio de nossos representantes, por e-mail ou por intermédio de outros serviços ou dispositivos da Verizon. Essas informações são usadas também para adaptar o conteúdo que você vê e igualmente para avaliar a eficácia de nossos sites e ajudá-lo a pedir ajuda em caso de problemas de navegação em nossos sites.\n\nSe optar por usar nosso serviço de recomendação para falar a um amigo sobre uma página em um de nossos sites, você será solicitado a enviar um e-mail diretamente ao seu amigo. Só faça isso se tiver permissão de seu amigo. Se seus amigos o encaminharem diretamente para nós, em determinadas regiões geográficas poderemos usar as informações de contato fornecidas para anunciar algo para você, de acordo com a lei aplicável. Em algumas localizações geográficas, e na proporção que a lei aplicável permitir, podemos monitorar ou gravar nossas conversas telefônicas para finalidade de controle de qualidade, treinamento e segurança.\n\nNós forneceremos informações específicas conforme exigido pela lei aplicável sobre como usamos seus dados pessoais com base no serviço específico que a Verizon fornecer para você ou para sua empresa.\n\nDe acordo com as leis locais de alguns países, devemos poder descrever a base legal sob a qual nos apoiamos para processar seus dados pessoais. Na maioria dos casos, processaremos seus dados pessoais para nossos interesses comerciais legítimos (por exemplo, para nos permitir entender como nossos serviços estão sendo usados e para derivar conhecimento que nos permita desenvolver novos serviços), quando for necessário para propósitos de contrato, ou quando for necessário para que atendamos a nossas obrigações legais. Ao processarmos seus dados pessoais para nossos interesses comerciais legítimos, utilizamos medidas de segurança para nos certificarmos de que sua privacidade será protegida e para garantir que nossos interesses legítimos não sejam desconsiderados pelos seus interesses ou direitos e liberdades fundamentais.\n\nEm determinadas circunstâncias (por exemplo, em relação a algumas de nossas atividades de marketing) e onde for exigido por lei, poderemos pedir seu consentimento para processar seus dados pessoais, e você poderá revogá-lo a qualquer momento. Para isso, entre em contato conosco usando os detalhes ao final deste aviso.\n\n#### 5. Quando a Verizon compartilha dados pessoais?\n\nA Verizon compartilha dados pessoais fora da família de empresas da Verizon conforme descrito nesta Política de Privacidade e nos avisos de privacidade de serviços específicos, como estabelecido em acordos com nossos clientes, com seu consentimento, e, de outro modo, onde temos uma base legal para fazê-lo sob as leis aplicáveis.\n\nTrabalhamos de perto com outros negócios e empresas na família de empresas da Verizon, e podemos compartilhar seus dados pessoais com elas para propósitos como um relatório interno, marketing, conhecimento sobre os clientes e otimização do serviço.\n\nA Verizon usa fornecedores e parceiros para uma variedade de finalidades comerciais para nos ajudar a produzir, oferecer, corrigir, restaurar e faturar os serviços que fornecemos. Compartilhamos dados pessoais com esses fornecedores e parceiros quando eles precisam realizar algum trabalho em nosso nome. Exigimos que esses fornecedores e parceiros protejam os dados pessoais que lhes fornecemos e restrinjam a usar esses dados pessoais para as finalidades para as quais eles foram fornecidos. Não permitimos que esses fornecedores e parceiros usem essas informações para finalidades de marketing próprias.\n\nA Verizon pode também compartilhar dados pessoais (i) quando for necessário ou permitido por lei ou obrigação regulatória; (ii) quando esses dados forem necessários para identificar, contatar ou abrir processo contra indivíduos que possam estar pondo em risco a segurança pública ou interferindo em propriedades ou serviços da Verizon – e se inclui como parte disso qualquer procedimento necessário para cobrar uma dívida de cliente – ou no uso que nossos clientes ou outras entidades fazem desses dados; ou (iii) quando relacionados a qualquer venda proposta ou real ou a outros tipos de transferência de parte ou de todos os nossos ativos. Essas divulgações só ocorrem de acordo com as leis aplicáveis.\n\nAlguns dos nossos sites ou serviços podem ser oferecidos conjuntamente pela Verizon e um de nossos parceiros. Se você se inscrever nesses sites ou serviços, a Verizon e a outra empresa podem receber dados pessoais. Com relação aos serviços oferecidos em conjunto, você deve também examinar a política de privacidade da empresa parceira, que pode incluir práticas diferentes das práticas descritas aqui.\n\nOs sites e serviços da Verizon podem incluir redes sociais ou outros plug-ins e widgets de terceiros que podem fornecer informações às redes sociais ou a terceiros associados sobre suas interações com as páginas da Verizon que você visita ou com os serviços que você usa, mesmo se você não clicar ou interagir de outra forma com o plug-in ou widget.\n\nCom relação a clientes da Verizon Enterprise Solutions no Japão, a Verizon usará dados pessoais em conjunto com sua família de empresas da maneira descrita a seguir. Tal como definido na segunda seção desta política de privacidade, a Verizon Japan Ltd usará dados pessoais em conjunto com a Verizon Business Network Services Inc. e as empresas da Verizon localizadas em países nos quais a Verizon Enterprise Solutions conduz negócios, para as finalidades expressas na quarta seção desta política de privacidade e pelos meios identificados na terceira seção desta política de privacidade.\n\n#### 6. A Verizon transfere dados pessoais internacionalmente?\n\nComo membro da família de empresas da Verizon ao redor do mundo, a empresa Verizon que fornece serviços para você pode, de acordo com a lei, transferir seus dados pessoais para outros membros da família de empresas da Verizon ou para parceiros e fornecedores terceirizados. As entidades que recebem seus dados pessoais podem usá-los somente para as finalidades para as quais eles foram originalmente compartilhados e elas devem protegê-los contra qualquer outro uso. Essas empresas podem estar localizadas fora do país em que você está. Embora esses países nem sempre tenham em vigor as mesmas leis de proteção de dados e privacidade que o país ou as proteções que eles oferecem talvez não sejam consideradas \"adequadas\" ou \"equivalentes\" às exigências de privacidade do país de seu serviço, a entidade da Verizon que fornece esse serviço obriga seus funcionários e fornecedores terceirizados globais a seguir o mesmo elevado padrão de proteção de informações pessoais que ela assegura a você. A Verizon adotou as Regras vinculativas para empresas (“BCRs”) para transferências de informações pessoais em alguns grupos de empresas da Verizon e tem proteções contratuais para outras transferências. As BCRs estão disponíveis aqui: www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. Além disso, as transferências podem ser baseadas no seu consentimento, o qual obteremos no momento adequado.\n\n#### 7. Como a Verizon protege os dados pessoais coletados?\n\nA Verizon leva a sério a confidencialidade e segurança dos clientes. A Verizon tem em vigor meios de proteção técnicos, administrativos e físicos para ajudar a oferecer proteção contra acesso, uso ou divulgação não autorizados de informações dos clientes que coletamos ou armazenamos, inclusive números de seguridade social. Os funcionários são treinados com relação à importância de proteger a privacidade e quanto ao acesso, uso e divulgação apropriados das informações dos clientes. De acordo com nossas práticas e políticas, o acesso a informações que podem ser identificadas como informações pessoais confidenciais só é autorizado para aqueles cujo acesso está associado a alguma necessidade comercial. Os dados pessoais e outros registros confidenciais são retidos desde que aceitavelmente necessários para finalidades comerciais, contábeis, fiscais ou legais; nesses casos, agimos de acordo com as leis aplicáveis, como a Lei Básica Fiscal Nacional, na Coreia do Sul, que exige que esses dados sejam retidos.\n\nEmbora nos esforcemos para proteger as informações pessoais que coletamos e armazenamos, nenhum programa é totalmente seguro, e não podemos garantir que nossos meios de proteção impedirão qualquer tentativa não autorizada de acesso, uso ou divulgação de informações pessoais. A Verizon mantém planos de segurança e resposta a incidentes para lidar com incidentes envolvendo acesso não autorizado às informações privadas que coletamos ou armazenamos.\n\n#### 8. Direitos de proteção de dados\n\nSujeito à lei aplicável, você pode pedir para acessar, atualizar, corrigir, portar, retificar e, quando razoavelmente viável, excluir seus dados pessoais ou revogar seu consentimento para usarmos seus dados pessoais. Você pode exercer seus direitos enviando um e-mail ou entrando em contato conosco por meio dos Detalhes de Contato da Empresa a seguir. Entretanto, observe que revogar o consentimento ou optar por excluir alguns tipos de informação pessoal pode nos impedir de fornecer determinados serviços a você, enquanto cliente, fornecedor ou parceiro, ou de responder às suas consultas como candidato a emprego ou contratado. Para protegê-lo mais adequadamente e salvaguardar suas informações, tomamos medidas para confirmar sua identidade antes de conceder acesso ou alterar suas informações.\n\nSe estiver no EEE, você terá o direito de registrar queixa à autoridade local responsável pela proteção de privacidade e também pode ter esse direito em outros países.\n\n#### 9. Detalhes de contato\n\nCom relação a consultas sobre esta política ou direitos de proteção de dados, envie sua dúvida diretamente para nós via e-mail ou escreva para nosso Oficial de Proteção de Dados no endereço a seguir:\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nRIBP Floor 1 Spur D Basingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nUnited Kingdom RG26DA\n\n#### 10. Atualizações de política\n\nReservamo-nos o direito de fazer alterações nesta política de privacidade. Por isso, examine-a periodicamente para ver se houve alterações. Você pode ver se houve alterações examinando a data efetiva publicada no final da política. Se a Verizon optar por usar ou divulgar seus dados pessoais de uma maneira extremamente diferente daquela expressa em nossa política na época em que coletamos essas informações, ofereceremos a você uma opção com relação ao uso e à divulgação por meios apropriados, o que pode incluir o uso de um mecanismo de opção por não participar.\n\n**24 de maio de 2018**",

      "content": "#### 1. Einleitung\n\nMit dieser Richtlinie soll erklärt werden, wie die Unternehmen des Verizon-Konzerns außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten (in dieser Richtlinie gemeinsam bezeichnet als „Verizon“, „wir“, „unser“ oder „uns“), Ihre personenbezogene Daten erheben und nutzen. Datenschutzgesetze weltweit verpflichten Verizon, Ihnen bestimmte Informationen bezüglich Erfassung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu liefern. Zusätzlich zu dieser allgemeinen Richtlinie können Sie weitere Informationen von uns darüber erhalten, wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten basierend auf der Art Ihrer Interaktion mit uns verwenden.\n\n#### 2. Welche Arten von personenbezogenen Daten erfasst Verizon?\n\nVerizon erfasst personenbezogene Daten von Kunden und deren Mitarbeitern, Antragstellern, Endnutzern, Lieferanten, Besuchern der Website, Apps-Nutzern und Bewerbern. Die erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten können Folgendes umfassen: Name, Adresse, Telefonnummer (Festnetz und/oder Mobiltelefon), E-Mail-Adresse, Name Ihres Unternehmens oder Arbeitgebers, Namen und Stellenbezeichnungen von Kontaktpersonen, Faxnummern, IP-Adressen, Geräteidentifikation und Standortinformationen, Informationen zum Dienst und zur Site-Nutzung, Daten zu Abrechnungen und Zahlungsvorgängen sowie Kreditkartendaten und andere Finanzdaten. Die Art der von uns gesammelten Informationen hängt zum Beispiel von den bestelltem oder beworbenen Diensten ab Für Kunden, die unsere Telematikdienste nutzen, erheben wir außerdem Fahrzeug- und Fahrtinformationen, einschließlich Standort und Geschwindigkeit.\n\n#### 3. Wie erlangt Verizon personenbezogene Daten?\n\nVerizon kann personenbezogene Daten auf verschiedene Weisen erlangen, z. B. über Aufträge, die Kunden und Endnutzer (telefonisch, per Fax oder E-Mail, über das Internet oder durch ein Anmeldeformular, Bestellformular oder einen Vertrag) erteilen, über Produkte und Dienstleistungen, Portale und Apps, Anfragen, die bestehende und potentielle Kunden stellen, sowie von Lieferanten, Subunternehmern oder Bewerbern.\n\nVerizon kann „Cookies“ oder eine ähnliche Technologie einsetzen, um Informationen über Besuche der Websites oder Ihre Antworten auf E-Mails von uns zu erlangen. Cookies sind kleine Textdateien, die im Speicher Ihres Computers und auf der Festplatte oder in Ihrem Mobilgerät abgelegt sind. Cookies ermöglichen die Funktion unserer Seiten oder können Informationen an Dritte liefern. Dies können Informationen über Sie, Ihre Voreinstellungen oder Ihr Gerät sein. Mit diesen Informationen werden Sie nicht direkt identifiziert, sie können Ihnen aber eine individuellere Benutzererfahrung vermitteln. Cookies erfüllen insbesondere folgende Funktionen: sie (a) helfen uns, die Qualität und Nützlichkeit unserer Seiten zu verbessern und ermitteln, welche Teile unserer Webseiten oder E-Mails für Sie interessant sind, (b) stellen Ihre technischen Voreinstellungen fest und speichern und erkennen Ihre Konfiguration und Benutzerattribute, (c) erleichtern die Navigation und (d) individualisieren Ihr Benutzererlebnis. Durch Cookies können wir außerdem den Zugriff auf passwortgeschützte Bereiche unserer Websites automatisieren, sodass Sie nicht jedes Mal, wenn Sie eine Website wieder besuchen, das Passwort erneut eingeben müssen.\n\n#### Es folgt eine Liste der Art von Cookies, die wir verwenden und Ihrer diesbezüglichen Optionen:\n\n- Wesentliche Cookies ermöglichen uns, den von Ihnen angeforderten Dienst bereitzustellen und helfen uns, die Website und ihre Merkmale sicher zu halten. Eine Deaktivierung dieser Cookies kann die Funktionsfähigkeit der Website beeinträchtigen. Sie dürfen sich von wesentlichen Cookies nicht abmelden.\n- Cookies für Nutzungspräferenzen werden aktiviert, wenn Sie eine bestimmte Auswahl auf unseren Seiten treffen und Passwörter und Voreinstellungen speichern, sodass wir das von uns gebotene Benutzererlebnis präzise auf Sie zuschneiden können. Mit diesen Cookies können Sie sich einverstanden erklären und Ihr Einverständnis auch wieder zurückziehen.\n- Analytische Cookies ermöglichen uns, die Verwendung unserer Seiten zu erkennen und zu messen und ein Protokoll dieser Nutzerinformationen zu erstellen, und sie helfen uns, die Funktionsweise unserer Seiten zu verbessern und weiterzuentwickeln. Unsere Seiten verwenden Google Analytics-Cookies, mit denen sich analysieren lässt, wie Benutzer unsere Seiten verwenden. Die von diesem Cookie generierten Informationen werden im Allgemeinen auf einem Google-Server in den USA gespeichert. Wenn Sie jedoch in der EU oder im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum ansässig sind, wird Ihre IP-Adresse vorher von Google gekürzt. Nur in Ausnahmefällen wird Ihre vollständige Adresse auf einen Google-Server in den USA übertragen und dort gekürzt. Google verwendet diese Informationen im Auftrag von Verizon, um Protokolle zur Website-Aktivität zusammenzustellen. Die von Ihrem Browser im Rahmen von Google Analytics übermittelte IP-Adresse wird mit keinen anderen von Google verwalteten Daten in Verbindung gebracht. Sie können die Übertragung von Webnutzungsdaten an Google verhindern, indem Sie ein Plug-in für Ihren Browser herunterladen und installieren. Mit diesen Cookies können Sie sich einverstanden erklären und Ihr Einverständnis auch wieder zurückziehen.\n- Von uns und Dritten gesendete Verhaltenswerbe-Cookies ermöglichen die Verfolgung Ihres Verhaltens auf bestimmten Seiten. Diese Informationen dienen zur (a) Bereitstellung eines individuellen Benutzererlebnisses durch Anzeigen auf bestimmten unserer Websites oder durch Anzeigen auf Websites Dritter oder zur (b) Kontrolle der Wirksamkeit unserer digitalen Marketing-Kampagnen. Mit Werbe-Cookies können Sie sich einverstanden erklären und Ihr Einverständnis auch wieder zurückziehen. Wir arbeiten mit Werbepartnern einschließlich Oath zusammen, welche die bewährten Praktiken für Online-Verhaltenswerbung der European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance und des britischen Internet Advertising Bureaus einhalten müssen. Mehr zu Verhaltenswerbung und wie Sie sich davon abmelden können, erfahren Sie vom Internet Advertising Bureau.\n\nJe nach ihrem Zweck werden einige Cookies nur für die Dauer einer einzelnen Internetsitzung betrieben, während andere über einen längeren Zeitraum laufen, um die vorgesehene Funktion zu erfüllen. Sie können Cookies über Ihren Internet-Browser oder andere handelsübliche Software blockieren oder löschen. Wenn Sie dies tun, stehen Ihnen aber möglicherweise einige Funktionen unserer Websites nicht zur Verfügung, und einige Technologien reagieren möglicherweise nicht auf Browser-Steuerung.\n\nE-Mails, die wir Ihnen senden, enthalten möglicherweise Webbeacons, mit denen wir feststellen, wie viele Leute unsere E-Mails öffnen oder auf einen Link in unseren E-Mails klicken. Wenn Sie keine Webbeacons in Ihren E-Mails zulassen möchten, können Sie HTML-Bilder deaktivieren oder HTML innerhalb Ihrer E-Mail-Software blockieren (Auswahl von „nur Text“).\n\nWir erhalten möglicherweise Informationen über Sie, die wir bei Konferenzen, Meetings und Seminaren erheben. Wir können Informationen über Chatrooms, Blog-Posts, Newsgroups und soziale Netzwerke erfassen. Die Daten, auf die wir in sozialen Netzwerken zugreifen können, variieren je nach Website und hängen von den Datenschutzeinstellungen ab, die Sie auf jeder Website festlegen.\n\nVerizon erhält außerdem Daten von Dritten. Beispielsweise kann Verizon Finanzdaten über Kunden und Endnutzer von Dritten erhalten, um die Risiken bei der Gewährung von Kreditrahmen einschätzen zu können. Eventuell erwerben wir Kontaktinformationen von Organisationen, die möglicherweise an unseren Produkten und Dienstleistungen interessiert sind.\n\n#### 4. Wie nutzt Verizon die personenbezogenen Daten, die erfasst werden?\n\nVerizon verwendet Ihre persönliche Daten zu verschiedenen Zwecken, einschließlich Erbringung unserer Dienstleistungen, Aktivierung Ihres Kontos, Abrechnung, technischer Support, Produktentwicklung und Auszahlungsanträge. Bei Telematikkunden kann Verizon Fahrzeug- und Fahrtinformationen mit personenbezogenen Daten verknüpfen. Außerdem nutzt Verizon personenbezogene Daten, um Dienste, die Verizon seinen Kunden anbietet, zu verbessern und Betrug und andere illegale Aktivitäten zu bekämpfen.\n\nWir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten ebenso nutzen, um Sie zu unseren Produkten und Diensten zu kontaktieren, einschließlich Umfragen. Wir nutzen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für Marketing- und andere Zwecke, die nicht mit dem jeweiligen Dienst in Zusammenhang stehen, wenn dies mit den anwendbaren Datenschutzgesetzen und den von Ihnen mitgeteilten Präferenzen in Einklang steht.\n\nWenn Sie die Websites und Apps von Verizon nutzen, werden Informationen zu Ihrem Gerät und Ihrem Besuch erhoben; dies umfasst Daten, Zeiten und Dauer der Besuche auf unseren Websites (einschließlich, ob es Ihr erster Besuch ist oder Sie die Website wiederholt besucht haben), Surf-, Such- und Kaufaktivitäten auf unseren Websites und über unsere Apps, IP-Adresse, Mobilfunknummer, Webadressen der Websites, die Sie vor bzw. nach unserer Website besucht haben – einschließlich Informationen dazu, ob Sie unsere Website direkt aufgerufen haben oder von einer anderen Website oder über einen Link dahin verwiesen wurden –, Standortinformationen entsprechend Ihren Browser-Einstellungen und Ihrer App-Auswahl sowie Informationen über Ihren Anschluss, einschließlich Browser, Betriebssystem und Plattformtyp Ihres Geräts. Wir nutzen diese Informationen für operative Leistungsmessung und andere Geschäftszwecke und um dazu beizutragen, dass Werbebotschaften von Verizon auf unseren Websites oder externen Websites zielgerichteter sind. Die Marketingbotschaften können von unseren Vertretern, über E-Mail oder über andere Dienste oder Geräte von Verizon bereitgestellt werden. Diese Informationen werden außerdem verwendet, um den Inhalt, den Sie sehen, auf Sie zuzuschneiden, sowie um die Effektivität unserer Websites zu beurteilen und um Ihnen zu helfen, wenn Sie Navigationsprobleme auf unseren Websites haben.\n\nWenn Sie unseren Empfehlungsservice nutzen möchten, um Freunde über eine Seite auf einer unserer Websites zu informieren, werden Sie gebeten, direkt eine E-Mail an Ihre Freunde zu schicken. Tun Sie das bitte nur, wenn Sie die Erlaubnis von Ihren Freunden eingeholt haben. Wenn Ihre Freunde Sie direkt an uns verweisen, können wir an bestimmten Standorten die mitgeteilten Kontaktinformationen gemäß anwendbarer Gesetzgebung für eine direkte Vermarktung an Sie nutzen. An einigen Standorten, wo wir vertreten sind, können wir im gesetzlich gestatteten Rahmen Ihre Telefongespräche mit uns zur Qualitätskontrolle, Schulung und Sicherheit überwachen oder aufzeichnen.\n\nWir machen spezifische Angaben nach geltendem Recht über die Art und Weise, in der wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten im Rahmen des jeweiligen Dienstes nutzen, den Verizon für Sie oder Ihr Unternehmen bereitstellt.\n\nDie örtlichen Gesetze in einigen Ländern verlangen, dass wir die gesetzliche Grundlage beschreiben können müssen, auf der wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten. In den meisten Fällen verarbeiten wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aus unseren berechtigten Geschäftsinteressen (damit wir z. B. nachvollziehen können, wie unsere Dienste genutzt werden und um daraus Kenntnisse abzuleiten, die uns helfen, neue Dienste zu entwickeln), wenn es aus vertraglichen Gründen notwendig ist oder wenn es für uns notwendig ist, um unsere gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen. Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aus berechtigten Geschäftsinteressen verarbeiten, sehen wir Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zum Schutz Ihrer Privatsphäre vor und um sicherzustellen, dass unsere legitimen Interessen nicht durch Ihre Interessen oder Grundrechte und Freiheiten beeinträchtigt werden.\n\nUnter bestimmten Umständen (z. B. in Bezug auf einige unserer Marketing-Aktivitäten) und wenn gesetzlich erforderlich, können wir Sie nach Ihrer Zustimmung zur Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten fragen, und Sie können Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zurückziehen, indem Sie uns auf dem am Ende dieser Mitteilung angegebenen Wege kontaktieren.\n\n#### 5. Wann gibt Verizon personenbezogene Daten weiter?\n\nVerizon gibt personenbezogene Daten außerhalb des Verizon-Konzerns weiter, wie in der vorliegenden Datenschutzrichtlinie und in den Datenschutzerklärungen für bestimmte Dienste beschrieben, wie in Vereinbarungen mit unseren Kunden festgelegt, mit Ihrer Zustimmung und auf andere Arten, für die es eine gesetzliche Grundlage unter geltendem Recht gibt.\n\nWir arbeiten eng mit anderen Unternehmen und Gesellschaften im Verizon-Konzern zusammen und geben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten möglicherweise aus Gründen wie interne Berichterstattung, Kundenwissen und Serviceoptimierung an diese weiter.\n\nVerizon nutzt Lieferanten und Partner für eine Reihe von Geschäftszwecken, z. B. für das Angebot, die Bereitstellung, die Reparatur, die Wiederherstellung und die Abrechnung von Diensten, die wir bereitstellen. Wir teilen diesen Lieferanten und Partnern personenbezogene Daten mit, wenn es für sie wichtig ist, um ihre Arbeit in unserem Namen durchzuführen. Wir fordern, dass diese Lieferanten und Partner die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir ihnen mitteilen, schützen und die Nutzung dieser personenbezogenen Daten auf die Zwecke beschränken, für die diese mitgeteilt wurden. Wir gestatten diesen Lieferanten und Partnern nicht, diese Informationen für ihre eigenen Marketingzwecke zu verwenden.\n\nVerizon kann Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch weitergeben, (i) wenn dies gesetzlich oder durch regulatorische Verpflichtungen erforderlich oder zulässig ist, (ii) wenn es notwendig ist, um Einzelpersonen zu identifizieren, zu kontaktieren oder gegen diese gerichtliche Schritte einzuleiten, die die öffentliche Sicherheit gefährden oder das Eigentum oder die Dienste von Verizon oder deren Nutzung durch unsere Kunden oder andere stören – einschließlich im Rahmen der Eintreibung von Schulden von Kunden – oder (iii) in Zusammenhang mit einem vorgeschlagenen oder tatsächlichen Verkauf oder einer anderen Übertragung einiger oder aller Vermögenswerte. Solche Offenlegung erfolgt nur gemäß anwendbarer Gesetzgebung.\n\nEinige unserer Websites oder Dienste werden möglicherweise gemeinsam von Verizon und einem unserer Partner angeboten. Wenn Sie sich für solche Websites oder Dienste registrieren oder diese nutzen, können Verizon und das andere Unternehmen personenbezogene Daten erhalten. Für diese gemeinsam angebotenen Dienste sollten Sie die Datenschutzrichtlinie des Partnerunternehmens prüfen. Diese enthält möglicherweise Praktiken, die von den hier angegebenen abweichen.\n\nWebseiten und Dienste von Verizon können Plug-ins und Widgets von sozialen Netzwerken oder anderen Dritten enthalten, die Informationen über Ihre Interaktionen mit Verizon-Seiten, die Sie besuchen oder Verizon-Diensten, die Sie nutzen, für die angeschlossenen sozialen Netzwerke oder Dritten bereitstellen können, auch wenn Sie nicht auf das jeweilige Plug-in oder Widget klicken oder auf sonstige Weise damit interagieren.\n\nFür Kunden von Verizon Enterprise Solutions in Japan nutzt Verizon personenbezogene Daten gemeinsam mit seiner Konzernfamilie auf die folgende Art und Weise. Verizon Japan Ltd nutzt personenbezogene Daten laut Definition in Absatz 2 dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie gemeinsam mit Verizon Business Network Services Inc. und den Unternehmen des Verizon-Konzerns mit Sitz in den Ländern, in denen Verizon Enterprise Solutions Geschäfte für die in Absatz 4 dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie genannten Zwecke über die in Absatz 3 dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie genannten Wege führt.\n\n#### 6. Überträgt Verizon personenbezogene Daten weltweit?\n\nAls Mitglied des weltweiten Verizon-Konzerns kann das Verizon-Unternehmen, das Ihnen den Dienst bereitstellt, laut Gesetz Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an andere Mitglieder der Verizon-Konzernfamilie oder externe Partner und Lieferanten übertragen. Unternehmen, die Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhalten, können diese nur zu dem Zweck oder den Zwecken, für die sie ursprünglich mitgeteilt wurden, verwenden, und sie müssen sie vor jeder weiteren Verwendung schützen. Diese Unternehmen können sich außerhalb des Landes befinden, in dem Sie ansässig sind. Auch wenn diese Länder nicht immer dieselben Gesetze zum Datenschutz haben wie Ihr Land oder möglicherweise kein Schutz geboten wird, der als „angemessen“ oder „gleichwertig“ zu den Datenschutzanforderungen in Ihrem Land angesehen wird, verpflichtet das Verizon-Unternehmen, das Ihnen den Dienst bereitstellt, seine weltweit tätigen Mitarbeiter und Drittanbieter zur Einhaltung des gleichen hohen Standards im Bereich Datenschutz, den es Ihnen gegenüber gewährt. Verizon hat verbindliche unternehmensinterne Vorschriften (Binding Corporate Rules, „BCRs“) für die Übermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten innerhalb einiger Unternehmen des Verizon-Konzerns eingeführt und für andere Übertragungen vertragliche Absicherungen vorgesehen. Die BCRs sind hier erhältlich: www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. Zusätzlich können Übermittlungen auf Ihrem Einverständnis basieren, das wir zu gegebener Zeit einholen.\n\n#### 7. Wie schützt Verizon die personenbezogenen Daten, die erfasst werden?\n\nVerizon nimmt die Vertraulichkeit und Sicherheit der Kundendaten ernst. Verizon verfügt über technische, administrative und physische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zum Schutz vor unbefugtem Zugriff auf die von uns gesammelten oder gespeicherten Kundendaten, einschließlich Sozialversicherungsnummern. Mitarbeiter wurden zur Bedeutung des Datenschutzes und zum richtigen Zugriff auf Kundeninformationen und deren Nutzung und Offenlegung geschult. Laut unseren Praktiken und Richtlinien ist der Zugriff auf sensible personenbezogene Daten nur denjenigen gestattet, die eine geschäftliche Notwendigkeit für solch einen Zugriff haben. Personenbezogene Daten und andere sensible Aufzeichnungen werden nur so lange aufbewahrt, wie es für geschäftliche, buchhalterische, steuerliche oder rechtliche Zwecke vernünftigerweise erforderlich ist, und wir befolgen die anwendbare Gesetzgebung wie das nationale Steuergesetz in Südkorea, durch das wir verpflichtet sind, personenbezogene Daten zu speichern.\n\nAuch wenn wir hart daran arbeiten, personenbezogene Daten, die wir erfassen und speichern, zu schützen, gibt es bei keinem Programm eine 100%-ige Sicherheit, und wir können nicht garantieren, dass unsere Sicherheitsvorkehrungen jeden nicht autorisierten Versuch verhindern, auf die personenbezogenen Informationen zuzugreifen, diese zu nutzen oder offenzulegen. Verizon unterhält Sicherheits- und Notfallpläne, um auf Vorfälle infolge eines unberechtigten Zugriffs auf personenbezogene Informationen, die wir erfassen oder speichern, zu reagieren.\n\n#### 8. Datenschutzrechte\n\nNach Maßgabe des geltenden Rechts können Sie verlangen, auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zuzugreifen, diese zu aktualisieren, zu korrigieren, zu portieren, zu berichtigen und im praktikablen Rahmen zu löschen oder Ihre Zustimmung zur Nutzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch uns zu widerrufen. Sie können Ihre Rechte geltend machen, indem Sie uns eine E-Mail oder uns unter Verwendung der unten aufgeführten Kontaktdaten kontaktieren. Bitte beachten Sie jedoch, dass wir durch den Widerruf Ihrer Zustimmung oder die Löschung einiger Ihrer personenbezogenen Informationen nicht mehr in der Lage sind, Ihnen bestimmte Dienste als Kunde, Lieferant oder Partner zu liefern oder auf Ihre Anfragen als Bewerber oder Subunternehmer zu antworten. Um Sie und Ihre Informationen besser zu schützen, überprüfen wir Ihre Identität, bevor wir Zugang zu Ihren Daten gewähren oder Änderungen daran vornehmen.\n\nWenn Sie im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum ansässig sind, haben Sie das Recht, eine Beschwerde bei der vor Ort für Datenschutz zuständigen Behörde einzureichen, und Sie sind möglicherweise auch in anderen Ländern dazu berechtigt.\n\n#### 9. Kontaktdetails\n\nFragen zu dieser Richtlinie oder Ihren Datenschutzrechten können Sie uns direkt oder E-Mail stellen, oder indem Sie unter folgender Adresse an unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten schreiben:\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nRIBP Floor 1 Spur D Basingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nGroßbritannien RG26DA\n\n#### 10. Aktualisierungen dieser Richtlinie\n\nWir behalten uns das Recht vor, diese Datenschutzrichtlinie zu ändern. Bitte prüfen Sie diese regelmäßig auf Änderungen. Ob Änderungen vorgenommen wurden, erkennen Sie am Datum des Inkrafttretens am Ende der Richtlinie. Wenn Verizon Informationen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in einer Art und Weise nutzen oder veröffentlichen möchte, die sich wesentlich von dem unterscheidet, was zum Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Daten von Ihnen erhoben wurden, in unserer Datenschutzrichtlinie angegeben war, werden wir Sie über geeignete Wege über Ihre Wahlmöglichkeit in Bezug auf die Nutzung oder Veröffentlichung, einschließlich der Nutzung eines Opt-Out-Mechanismus, informieren.\n\nKürzlich durchgeführte Änderungen an der Datenschutzrichtlinie ansehen\n\n**24.

      "content": "# International Privacy Policy\n\nOur policy is available in 16 Languages.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to explain how the Verizon companies (which we will collectively refer to in this policy as “Verizon”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collect and use your personal data. Privacy laws around the globe require Verizon to provide you with certain information applicable to our collection of your personal data. In addition to this general policy, you may receive additional information as to how we use your personal data based upon how you interact with us.\n\n## What types of personal data does Verizon collect?\n\nVerizon collects personal data from customers and their employees, applicants, end users, suppliers, website visitors, application users, and job candidates. The personal data collected may include: name, address, telephone number (wireline and/or mobile), email address, the name of your company or employer, individual contact names and job titles, fax numbers, IP addresses, device identification and location information, service and site usage information, billing and transaction information, and credit card or other financial information. The nature of the information we collect will depend upon, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted. For customers who use our telematics services, we also collect vehicle and driving information, including information such as location and speed.\n\n## How does Verizon obtain personal data?\n\nVerizon may obtain personal data in a number of ways, including from orders placed by customers and end users, (whether by telephone, fax or e-mail, Internet or by application form, order form or a contract), from products and services, portals and apps, enquiries made by existing customers and potential customers, and from vendors, contractors or applicants.\n\nVerizon may use \"cookies\" and similar technology to obtain information about visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your computer’s memory and hard drive or your mobile device. Cookies are used to enable our sites to function or may provide information to third parties. This information might be about you, your preferences, or your device. The information does not directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalized experience. Specifically, cookies (a) help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites and determine which parts of our web sites or e-mails are of interest to you, (b) identify your technology preferences, including storing and recognising your configuration and user attributes, (c) facilitate navigation, and (d) personalize your experience. Use of cookies may also allow us to automate entry into password-protected portions of our websites so that you will not need to re-enter your password each time you visit such website.\n\nThe following is a list of the types of cookies we use and your options related to them:\n\n- Essential cookies enable us to provide the service you requested and help us keep the website and its features safe and secure. Disabling these cookies may affect the functionality of the website. You may not opt out of essential cookies.\n- Usage preferences cookies are activated when you make certain choices on our sites and remember passwords and settings preferences, permitting us to tailor the experience we provide to you. You can opt-in and withdraw your consent to these cookies.\n- Analytical cookies allow us to recognize and measure your use of our sites, compile a record of this usage information, and help us improve and develop the way our sites work. Our sites use Google Analytics cookies to help analyze how users use our sites. The information generated by the cookie will normally be stored on a Google server in the US. However, if you are located within the EU or the European Economic Area, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand. In exceptional cases only, your full address will be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of Verizon, Google will use this information for the purpose of compiling reports on website activity. The IP address transmitted from your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You may prevent web usage data being transmitted to Google if you download and install a browser plug-in. You can opt-in and withdraw your consent to these cookies.\n- Behavioral advertising cookies posted by us and third parties allow for the monitoring of your behavior on certain sites. This information is used to (a) provide a customized experience via advertisements on certain of our websites or through advertisements on third party websites, or (b) monitor the effectiveness of our digital marketing campaigns. You can opt-in and withdraw your consent to these cookies. We use advertising partners which must adhere to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance's and the Internet Advertising Bureau UK's Good Practice Principals for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt out of behavioral advertising from the Internet Advertising Bureau.\n- If you are a Senion at work user, the Senion application collects data using Google Analytics for Firebase or an equivalent SDK and utilises identifiers for mobile devices (e.g., Android Advertising Identifier or Advertising Identifier for iOS). For further information on the use of this service by google, and how it collects and processes data use the link https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites \"How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps\"\n\nDepending on their purpose, some cookies will only operate for the length of a single browsing session, while others will operate for a longer time in order to function as intended. You have the option to delete or block cookies through your Internet browser or other commercially available software, but doing so may make some of our sites' features unavailable to you, and these controls may not work with some technologies.\n\nEmails we send you may include web beacons we use to determine the number of people who open or click on links in our emails. If you do not wish to allow web beacons on email you receive, you may disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) within your email software.\n\nWe may obtain information about you that we collect at conferences, meetings and seminars. We also may collect information through chat rooms, blog posts, newsgroups, and social networking sites. The information you allow us to access on social networking sites varies by site, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish at each site.\n\nVerizon also obtains data from third parties. For example, Verizon may obtain financial information about customers and end users from third parties to enable it to assess its risks in granting credit terms, and we may also purchase contact information related to organizations that might be interested in our products and services.\n\n## How does Verizon use the personal data It collects?\n\nVerizon uses your personal data for various purposes, including providing our services, enabling your account, billing, technical support, product development, and payment application. For telematics customers, Verizon may link vehicle and driving information to personal data. In addition, Verizon uses personal data to improve services that Verizon offers to its customers and to combat fraud and other illegal activity.\n\nWe may also use your personal data to contact you regarding our products and services, including survey requests. We will use your personal data for marketing or other purposes unrelated to your specific service when this is in accordance with applicable data protection or privacy law and any preferences you express.\n\nWhen you use Verizon websites and apps, information is collected about your device and your visit including dates, times and duration of visits to our sites (including whether you are a first-time or repeat visitor); browsing, searching and buying activity as you interact with our sites and apps; IP address; mobile telephone number; web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next, including whether you visited the website directly or were referred from another website or link; location information consistent with your browser settings and app choice; and information about your connection, including your device's browser, operating system, and platform type. We use this information for operational, performance measurement and other business purposes, and to help us deliver more relevant Verizon marketing messages on our websites, on non-Verizon websites. The marketing messages may be delivered by our representatives, via email, or via other Verizon services or devices. This information is also used to tailor the content you see and may also be used to assess the effectiveness of our sites and to help you should you request help with navigation problems on our sites.\n\nIf you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a page on one of our websites, you will be asked to submit an email to your friend directly. Please do so only if you have the permission of your friend. If your friends refer you to us directly, we may in certain geographic locations use the contact information provided in order to market to you, in accordance with applicable law. In some of our geographic locations, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may monitor or record your telephone conversations with us for quality control, training, and security purposes.\n\nWe will provide specific information as required by applicable law about how we use your personal data based upon the particular service that Verizon provides to you or to your company.\n\nUnder the local laws in some countries, we must be able to describe the legal basis on which we rely to process your personal data. In most cases, we will process your personal data for our legitimate business interests (for example, to enable us to understand how our services are used and to derive knowledge that enables us to develop new services), when it is necessary for purposes of a contract, or when it is necessary for us to do so to meet our legal obligations. When we process your personal data for our legitimate business interests, we put in place safeguards to make sure that your privacy is protected and to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nIn certain circumstances (for example, in relation to some of our marketing activities) and where required by law, we may ask for your consent to process your personal data, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this notice.\n\n## When does Verizon share personal data?\n\nVerizon shares personal data outside the Verizon family of companies as described in this Privacy Policy and in the privacy notices for specific services, as set forth in agreements with our customers, with your consent, and otherwise where we have a legal basis to do so under applicable law.\n\nWe work closely with other businesses and companies in the Verizon family of companies, and we may share your personal data with them for purposes such as internal reporting, marketing, customer insights and service optimization.\n\nVerizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services we provide. We share personal data with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. We require that these vendors and partners protect the personal data we provide to them and limit their use of personal data to the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.\n\nVerizon may also share personal data when it is (i) required or permitted to do so by law or regulatory obligation; (ii) necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with Verizon property or services—including as part of any procedure necessary to collect a customer debt—or our customers’ or others’ use of them; or (iii) in connection with any proposed or actual sale or other transfer of some or all of our assets. Such disclosures occur only in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nSome of our websites or services may be offered jointly by Verizon and one of our partners. If you register for or use such websites or services, Verizon and the other company may receive personal data. For these jointly offered services, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy, which may include practices that are different from the practices described here.\n\nVerizon websites and services may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with Verizon pages you visit or services you use, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.\n\nFor Verizon Enterprise Solutions customers in Japan, Verizon will jointly use personal data with its family of companies in the following manner. Verizon Japan Ltd will jointly use personal data as defined in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy with Verizon Business Network Services Inc. and the Verizon companies located in the countries in which Verizon Enterprise Solutions conducts businesses for the purposes set forth in Section 4 of this Privacy Policy by the means identified in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.\n\n## Does Verizon transfer personal data internationally?\n\nAs a member of the Verizon family of companies worldwide, the Verizon company providing service to you may in accordance with law transfer your personal data to other members of the Verizon family of companies or to third party partners and suppliers. Entities that receive your personal data may use it only for the purpose(s) for which it was originally shared, and they must protect it from any further use. These companies may be located outside the country where you are located. Although these countries do not always have the same data protection or privacy laws in place as your country or may not be deemed to provide protections that are \"adequate\" or \"equivalent\" to the privacy requirements of your service country, the Verizon entity providing your service binds its global employees and third party providers to the same high standard of personal information protection that it commits to you. Verizon adopted Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for transfers of personal information within some of the Verizon group of companies and has contractual protections in place for other transfers.\n\nThe BCRs are available here: www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. In addition, transfers may be based on your consent, which we will obtain at the appropriate time.\n\n## How does Verizon protect the personal data it collects?\n\nVerizon takes customer confidentiality and security seriously. Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store, including social security numbers. Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information. Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access. Personal data and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes, and we abide by applicable laws such as the National Tax Basic Act in South Korea that require us to retain personal data.\n\nAlthough we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. Verizon maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.\n\n## Data protection rights\n\nSubject to applicable law, you may ask to access, update, correct, port, rectify and, where reasonably practical, delete your personal data, or withdraw your consent to our use of your personal data. You may exercise your rights by emailing us or contacting us through the Company Contact Details below. Please note, however, that withdrawing consent or choosing to delete some types of personal information may prevent us from supplying certain services to you as a customer, vendor or partner, or responding to your queries as a job applicant or contractor. In order to better protect you and safeguard your information, we take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your information.\n\nIf you are in the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local authority responsible for privacy protection, and you may also have this right in other countries.\n\n## Policy updates\n\nWe reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy, so please check back periodically for changes. You will be able to see that changes have been made by checking to see the effective date posted at the end of the policy. If Verizon elects to use or disclose your personal data in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our policy at the time we collected that information from you, we will give you a choice regarding such use or disclosure by appropriate means, which may include use of an opt out mechanism.\n\nView recent changes\n\nLast updated on January 18, 2023\n\n### Contact us with any questions or concerns related to privacy.\n\n#### Write\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nReading International Business Park\n\nBasingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nRG2 6DA\n\nUK\n\nFill out this form if you have questions about the use of your personal data.\n\nAccess form",

      "content": "#### 1. Introduction\n\nLa présente politique vise à expliquer la manière dont les sociétés Verizon situées à l'extérieur des États-Unis (collectivement appelées « Verizon », « nous », « notre » ou « nos » dans la présente politique) recueillent et utilisent vos données personnelles. Verizon est tenue par les lois sur la protection de la vie privée du monde entier de vous fournir certains renseignements sur la collecte de vos données personnelles. En plus de la présente politique générale, vous pourriez recevoir des informations supplémentaires sur la façon dont nous utilisons vos données personnelles en fonction des échanges que vous avez avec nous.\n\n#### 2. Quels types de données personnelles Verizon recueille-t-elle?\n\nVerizon recueille les données personnelles de ses clients et de ses employés, des demandeurs, des utilisateurs finaux, des fournisseurs, des visiteurs du site Web, des utilisateurs des applications et des postulants. Voici des exemples de données personnelles qui peuvent être recueillies : le nom, l'adresse, le numéro de téléphone (fixe ou mobile, ou les deux), l'adresse électronique, le nom de votre entreprise ou de votre employeur, le nom et le titre de personnes-ressources, les numéros de télécopieur, les adresses IP, l'identification des appareils et des renseignements sur leur emplacement, des renseignements sur l'utilisation du site Web et du service, des renseignements sur la facturation et sur les opérations ainsi que des renseignements sur la carte de crédit ou d'autres renseignements financiers. La nature des renseignements que nous pourrions recueillir dépendra, par exemple, du ou des services commandés ou recommandés. Nous recueillons également des renseignements sur les véhicules et la conduite des clients qui utilisent nos services télématiques, y compris des renseignements sur l'emplacement et la vitesse.\n\n#### 3. De quelle façon Verizon obtient-elle des données personnelles?\n\nVerizon peut obtenir des données personnelles de diverses façons, notamment à partir des commandes passées par les clients et les utilisateurs finaux (que ce soit par téléphone, par télécopie ou par courriel, ou par l'intermédiaire d'Internet, d'un formulaire de demande, d'un formulaire de commande ou d'un contrat), des produits et services, des portails et des applications, des demandes de renseignements provenant de clients actuels ou éventuels ainsi qu'auprès des fournisseurs, des agents contractuels ou des postulants à un emploi.\n\nVerizon peut avoir recours à des témoins et à des technologies similaires pour obtenir des renseignements concernant les visites effectuées sur nos sites ou les réponses données aux courriels reçus de notre part. Les témoins (« cookies ») sont de petits fichiers texte stockés dans la mémoire et sur le disque dur de votre ordinateur ou sur votre appareil mobile. Ils sont utilisés pour permettre à nos sites Web de fonctionner ou pour fournir des renseignements à des tiers. Ces renseignements peuvent vous concerner, indiquer vos préférences ou caractériser votre appareil. Ils ne vous identifient pas directement, mais vous assurent une expérience plus personnalisée. En particulier, les témoins (a) nous aident à améliorer la qualité et l'utilité de nos sites Web et déterminent quelles parties de nos sites Web ou de nos courriels vous intéressent, (b) révèlent vos préférences technologiques, y compris en stockant et en reconnaissant votre configuration et vos attributs d'utilisateur, (c) facilitent la navigation et (d) personnalisent votre expérience. Le recours à des témoins peut également nous permettre d'automatiser l'entrée dans des sections protégées par mot de passe de nos sites Web. Ainsi, vous n'avez pas à saisir votre mot de passe toutes les fois que vous les visitez.\n\nLa liste qui suit indique les types de témoins que nous utilisons et les options qui vous sont offertes à leur égard :\n\nLes témoins essentiels nous permettent de vous fournir le service que vous avez demandé et nous aident à garantir la sécurité du site Web et de ses fonctionnalités. La désactivation de ces témoins peut nuire au fonctionnement du site Web. Vous ne pouvez pas désactiver les témoins essentiels.\n\nLes témoins de préférences d'utilisation sont activés lorsque vous effectuez certains choix sur nos sites Web et ils servent à garder en mémoire vos mots de passe et vos paramètres préférentiels, ce qui nous permet de personnaliser l'expérience que nous vous fournissons. Vous avez le choix de donner ou de retirer votre consentement à l'utilisation de ces témoins.\n\nLes témoins analytiques nous permettent de reconnaître et de mesurer vos habitudes d'utilisation de nos sites, de compiler et d'enregistrer ces informations d'utilisation et d'améliorer et de développer le fonctionnement de nos sites Web. Nos sites utilisent des témoins de Google Analytics pour nous aider à analyser la manière dont les internautes utilisent nos sites. Les informations produites par ces témoins seront normalement stockées sur un serveur de Google aux États-Unis. Toutefois, si vous vous trouvez dans l'UE ou dans l'Espace économique européen, votre adresse IP sera préalablement raccourcie par Google. Dans des cas exceptionnels, votre adresse complète sera transmise à un serveur de Google aux États-Unis pour être raccourcie à cet endroit. Google utilisera ces informations pour le compte de Verizon dans le but de produire des rapports d'activité sur le site Web. L'adresse IP transmise par votre navigateur au service Google Analytics ne sera associée à aucune autre donnée détenue par Google. Vous pouvez empêcher la transmission à Google de données sur votre utilisation d'Internet si vous téléchargez et installez un module d'extension de votre navigateur. Vous avez le choix de donner ou de retirer votre consentement à l'utilisation de ces témoins.\n\nLes témoins publicitaires comportementaux que nous publions et que publient des tiers permettent de suivre votre comportement sur certains sites Web. Ces informations sont utilisées pour (a) fournir une expérience personnalisée à l'aide de publicités sur certains de nos sites Web ou sur des sites Web de tiers, ou pour (b) contrôler l'efficacité de nos campagnes de marketing en ligne. Vous avez le choix de donner ou de retirer votre consentement à l'utilisation des témoins publicitaires. Nous faisons appel à des partenaires publicitaires, dont Oath, qui doivent adhérer aux Principes de bonnes pratiques en matière de publicité comportementale en ligne de l'Alliance européenne pour la publicité numérique interactive et de l'Internet Advertising Bureau UK. Vous pouvez en apprendre davantage et retirer votre consentement à recevoir de la publicité comportementale en vous adressant à l'Internet Advertising Bureau.\n\n\nSelon leur nature et leur raison d'être, certains témoins ne fonctionneront que pendant la durée d'une même session de navigation, tandis que d'autres sont conçus pour rester actifs pendant une plus longue période. Il est possible de détruire ou de bloquer les témoins par l'intermédiaire de votre navigateur Internet ou de tout autre logiciel vendu sur le marché. Cependant, ce faisant, certaines fonctionnalités de nos sites pourraient ne plus vous être offertes et ces méthodes de contrôle pourraient n'avoir aucune incidence sur certaines technologies.\n\nLes courriels que nous vous transmettons peuvent comprendre des pixels invisibles, qui nous aident à déterminer le nombre de personnes qui ouvrent nos courriels ou qui cliquent sur les liens qu'ils contiennent. Si vous souhaitez interdire la transmission de pixels invisibles dans les courriels que vous recevez, vous pouvez désactiver les images HTML ou refuser l'affichage du code HTML (sélectionnez Texte uniquement) dans votre logiciel de courriel.\n\nNous pourrions obtenir des renseignements vous concernant lors de conférences, de rencontres et de séminaires. Nous pourrions également recueillir des renseignements dans des clavardoirs, des billets de blogue, des forums et des sites de réseautage social. Les renseignements auxquels vous nous donnez accès sur les sites de réseautage social varieront selon le site. L'accès sera déterminé par les paramètres de confidentialité que vous établissez pour chaque site.\n\nVerizon obtient également des données auprès de tiers. Par exemple, Verizon peut obtenir des renseignements financiers sur ses clients et utilisateurs finaux auprès de tiers afin d'évaluer les risques qu'elle encoure si elle accepte les modalités de crédit. En outre, nous pourrions acheter les coordonnées des organisations qui pourraient s'intéresser à nos produits et services.\n\n#### 4. Quel usage Verizon fait-elle des données personnelles qu'elle recueille?\n\nVerizon utilise vos données personnelles pour diverses raisons, y compris pour la prestation de nos services, pour l'activation de votre compte, pour la facturation, pour le soutien technique, pour la conception de produits et pour les paiements. Verizon pourrait associer les renseignements relatifs au véhicule et à la conduite aux données personnelles des clients de la télématique. En outre, Verizon se sert des données personnelles pour améliorer les services qu'elle offre à ses clients ainsi que pour lutter contre la fraude et les autres activités illégales.\n\nNous pourrions également utiliser vos données personnelles pour communiquer avec vous à propos de nos produits et services, y compris pour vous demander de prendre part à des sondages. Nous utiliserons vos données personnelles à des fins de marketing ou à d'autres fins non liées au service, lorsque cela est conforme aux lois sur la protection des données ou sur la vie privée applicables ainsi qu'aux préférences que vous avez exprimées.\n\nLorsque vous utilisez les sites Web et applications de Verizon, des renseignements sont recueillis à propos de votre appareil et de votre visite, notamment les dates, les heures et les durées des visites faites à nos sites (y compris si vous visitez le site pour la première fois ou si vous le faites fréquemment); des activités de navigation, de recherche et d'achat que vous effectuez lors de vos interactions avec nos sites et applications, de l'adresse IP, du numéro de téléphone mobile, des adresses Web des sites d'où vous provenez et des sites vers lesquels vous vous dirigez, y compris si vous avez visité le site directement ou si vous y avez accédé à partir d'un autre site Web ou d'un lien. Nous recueillons également des renseignements sur l'emplacement qui concordent avec les paramètres de votre navigateur et vos choix d'application, ainsi que des renseignements concernant votre connexion, y compris le navigateur, le système d'exploitation et le type de plateforme de votre appareil. Nous nous servons de ces renseignements à des fins opérationnelles et de mesure du rendement ainsi qu'à d'autres fins commerciales. Ils nous servent également à accroître la pertinence des messages marketing transmis sur nos sites Web ou sur des sites Web n'appartenant pas à Verizon. Les messages marketing peuvent être transmis par nos représentants, par courriel ou par l'intermédiaire d'autres services ou appareils de Verizon. Ces renseignements permettent également de personnaliser le contenu que vous voyez et, éventuellement, d'évaluer l'efficacité de nos sites et, lorsque vous le demandez, de vous offrir de l'aide relativement à des problèmes de navigation sur nos sites.\n\nSi vous décidez d'utiliser notre service de recommandation pour transmettre une page de l'un de nos sites Web à un ami, vous serez invité à lui envoyer un courriel directement. Avant d'envoyer un tel courriel, assurez-vous d'avoir l'autorisation de votre ami. Dans certaines régions, nous pourrions utiliser les coordonnées fournies directement par vos amis pour vous offrir des produits, conformément aux lois applicables. Dans certains endroits, et dans la mesure permise par la loi applicable, il se peut que nous surveillions ou enregistrions les conversations téléphoniques que vous avez avec nous à des fins de contrôle de la qualité, de formation et de sécurité.\n\nNous fournirons des informations spécifiques, conformément à la réglementation applicable, sur la manière dont nous utilisons vos données personnelles en fonction du service que Verizon vous fournit ou qu'elle fournit à votre entreprise.\n\nEn vertu de la réglementation locale de certains pays, nous devons être en mesure de décrire le fondement juridique sur lequel nous nous appuyons pour traiter vos données personnelles. Dans la plupart des cas, nous traiterons vos données personnelles en fonction de nos intérêts commerciaux légitimes (par exemple, pour nous permettre de comprendre comment nos services sont utilisés et pour acquérir des connaissances nous permettant de développer de nouveaux services), aux fins de contrats, le cas échéant, ou lorsque nous devons le faire pour remplir nos obligations légales. Lorsque nous traitons vos données personnelles en fonction de nos intérêts commerciaux légitimes, nous mettons en place des mécanismes de sauvegarde pour garantir la protection de votre vie privée et pour assurer que nos intérêts légitimes ne sont pas lésés par vos intérêts ou vos droits fondamentaux.\n\nDans certaines circonstances (par exemple, dans le cadre de certaines de nos activités marketing) et lorsque la loi l'exige, nous pourrions vous demander votre consentement pour traiter vos données personnelles. Vous pouvez par ailleurs retirer votre consentement à tout moment en entrant en contact avec nous en utilisant les coordonnées qui se trouvent à la fin du présent avis.\n\n#### 5. Dans quelles situations Verizon transmet-elle des données personnelles?\n\nVerizon partage des données personnelles avec des entités n'appartenant pas à la famille de sociétés Verizon comme le décrit la présente politique de protection de la vie privée et comme le décrivent les avis en matière de confidentialité relatifs à des services spécifiques. Le partage des données se fait par ailleurs conformément aux ententes conclues avec nos clients, en vertu de votre consentement ou, autrement, lorsque nous disposons d'un fondement juridique pour le faire en vertu de la loi applicable.\n\nNous travaillons en étroite collaboration avec d'autres entreprises et d'autres sociétés de la famille Verizon, et nous pouvons partager vos données personnelles avec elles à des fins telles que la préparation de rapports internes, les activités marketing, l'acquisition de connaissances sur les clients et l'optimisation des services.\n\nVerizon fait appel à des fournisseurs et à des partenaires pour réaliser une diversité d'objectifs commerciaux, comme nous aider à offrir, à rétablir, à corriger et à facturer les services que nous offrons. Nous transmettons des données personnelles à ces fournisseurs et partenaires lorsqu'ils en ont besoin pour accomplir le travail qu'ils sont tenus d'effectuer pour notre compte. Nous exigeons que ces fournisseurs et partenaires protègent les données personnelles que nous leur fournissons et restreignons leur utilisation aux seules fins pour lesquelles elles ont été fournies. Nous n'autorisons pas ces types de fournisseurs et de partenaires à utiliser ces données à leurs propres fins de marketing.\n\nVerizon peut également transmettre des données personnelles (i) lorsqu'elle est autorisée ou contrainte de le faire en vertu de la loi ou d'une obligation réglementaire; (ii) lorsqu'elles sont nécessaires pour mettre au jour des personnes qui sont susceptibles de mettre en danger la sécurité des personnes ou d'interférer avec la propriété ou les services de Verizon (ou leur utilisation par nos clients ou par autrui), pour communiquer avec de telles personnes ou pour intenter une action en justice contre ces dernières, y compris dans le cadre de toute procédure nécessaire pour recouvrer la dette d'un client; ou (iii) dans le cas d'une vente, proposée ou réelle, ou de tout autre transfert d'une partie ou de la totalité de nos actifs. De telles divulgations seront effectuées uniquement en conformité avec les lois applicables.\n\nCertains de nos sites Web ou services peuvent être proposés conjointement par Verizon et l'un de nos partenaires. Si vous vous inscrivez à de tels sites Web ou services, ou que vous les utilisez, Verizon et l'autre société pourraient recevoir des données personnelles. Pour ces services offerts conjointement, vous devriez également passer en revue la politique de protection de la vie privée de la société, qui pourrait prévoir des pratiques différentes de celles décrites dans la présente.\n\nLes sites Web et les services de Verizon peuvent être liés à des réseaux sociaux, des modules d'extension et des vignettes actives appartenant à des tiers. Ceux-ci peuvent transmettre des renseignements à des réseaux sociaux ou à d'autres tiers concernant les pages Web de Verizon que vous visitez ou concernant les services que vous utilisez. Ces renseignements peuvent être transmis même si vous ne cliquez pas sur le module d'extension ou sur la vignette active, et même si vous ne les activez pas d'autre manière.\n\nPour les clients de Verizon Enterprise Solutions au Japon, Verizon utilisera conjointement les données personnelles avec sa famille de sociétés de la manière suivante : Verizon Japan Ltd utilisera conjointement les données personnelles selon la définition donnée à l'article 2 de la présente Politique de protection de la vie privée avec Verizon Business Network Services Inc. Et les sociétés Verizon situées dans les pays dans lesquels Verizon Enterprise Solutions mène ses activités aux fins stipulées à l'article 4 de la présente Politique de protection de la vie privée des façons énoncées à l'article 3 de la présente Politique de protection de la vie privée.\n\n#### 6. Verizon transmet-elle des données personnelles à l'échelle internationale?\n\nEn tant que membre de la famille de sociétés Verizon dans le monde, la société Verizon qui vous offre des services peut, conformément aux lois, transférer vos données personnelles à d'autres membres de la famille de sociétés Verizon ou à des partenaires ou fournisseurs tiers. Les entités qui reçoivent vos données personnelles peuvent les utiliser uniquement aux fins pour lesquelles elles ont été initialement transmises. Elles doivent les protéger de toute autre utilisation. Ces sociétés peuvent être situées à l'extérieur du pays dans lequel vous vous trouvez. Bien que les lois en matière de protection des données et de la vie privée de ces pays puissent différer de celles du pays où vous vous trouvez, ou que ces pays puissent offrir des protections qui ne sont pas considérées comme « adéquates » ou « équivalentes » aux exigences en matière de protection de la vie privée du pays dans lequel vous recevez vos services, l'entité de Verizon qui vous offre vos services contraint l'ensemble de ses employés et de ses fournisseurs tiers à respecter les mêmes normes élevées de protection des renseignements personnels qu'elle s'est engagée à respecter. Verizon a adopté les Règles d'entreprise contraignantes (« BCR ») pour les transferts de renseignements personnels au sein de certaines sociétés du groupe Verizon et a mis en place des protections contractuelles pour les transferts de données avec les autres entités avec lesquelles elle collabore. On peut consulter les Règles d'entreprise contraignantes ici : www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules. En outre, les transferts de données peuvent dépendre de votre consentement, que nous chercherons à obtenir au moment opportun.\n\n#### 7. Comment Verizon protège-t-elle les données personnelles qu'elle recueille?\n\nVerizon prend la confidentialité et la sécurité de ses clients très au sérieux. Verizon a mis en place des mesures de sécurité administratives, techniques et physiques appropriées pour se protéger contre les accès non autorisés aux renseignements des clients que nous recueillons ou stockons, y compris les numéros d'assurance sociale, et contre leur utilisation ou leur divulgation. Les employés ont reçu une formation sur l'importance de protéger la vie privée ainsi que sur l'accès approprié aux renseignements des clients, sur leur utilisation et sur leur divulgation. En vertu de nos pratiques et politiques, seules les personnes qui ont besoin des renseignements de nature délicate permettant de vous identifier dans le cadre de leurs fonctions sont autorisées à y accéder. Les données personnelles et les autres dossiers confidentiels sont conservés le temps nécessaire à des fins commerciales, comptables, fiscales ou juridiques. De plus, nous respectons les lois applicables, comme la Loi nationale de l'impôt de base de la Corée du Sud, qui nous oblige à conserver les données personnelles.\n\nBien que nous déployions tous les efforts pour protéger les renseignements personnels que nous recueillons et stockons, aucun programme n'est complètement sûr. Par conséquent, nous ne pouvons garantir que nos mesures de protection empêcheront toute tentative non autorisée d'accéder aux renseignements personnels, de les utiliser ou de les divulguer. Verizon tient à jour des plans d'intervention en cas d'incident et en matière de sécurité pour gérer les incidents impliquant un accès non autorisé aux renseignements privés que nous recueillons ou stockons.\n\n#### 8. Droits en matière de protection des données\n\nLorsque les lois applicables le permettent, vous pouvez demander d'accéder à vos données personnelles, de les mettre à jour, de les corriger, de les adapter, de les rectifier et, lorsqu'une telle chose est raisonnablement possible, de les supprimer. De plus, lorsqu'une telle chose est raisonnablement possible, vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à l'utilisation de vos données personnelles. Vous pouvez faire valoir vos droits en nous envoyant un courriel ou en nous contacter à l'aide des coordonnées de la société ci-dessous. Veuillez toutefois prendre note que si vous décidez de retirer votre consentement ou de supprimer certains types de renseignements personnels, nous pourrions ne pas pouvoir vous fournir certains services à titre de client, de fournisseur ou de partenaire, ou répondre à vos questions en tant que postulant ou qu'agent contractuel. Afin de mieux vous protéger et de sauvegarder les renseignements vous concernant, nous prenons des mesures pour vérifier votre identité avant d'accorder l'accès à vos renseignements ou d'y apporter des modifications.\n\nSi vous résidez dans l'EÉE, vous avez également le droit de porter plainte auprès de l'autorité déléguée en matière de protection de la vie privée. Vous pourriez par ailleurs disposer d'un même droit dans d'autres pays.\n\n#### 9. Coordonnées\n\nVeuillez nous transmettre directement toute question à propos de la présente politique ou de vos droits en matière de protection des données par courriel, à l'adresse ou par écrit à notre Responsable de la protection des données à l'adresse suivante :\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nRIBP Floor 1 Spur D Basingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nUnited Kingdom RG26DA\n\n#### 10. Mises à jour de la politique\n\nNous nous réservons le droit d'apporter des modifications à la présente politique de protection de la vie privée, veuillez donc vérifier périodiquement si des changements y ont été apportés. Pour ce faire, il suffit de consulter la date d'entrée en vigueur indiquée à la fin de la politique. Si Verizon choisit d'utiliser ou de divulguer vos renseignements personnels d'une manière qui diffère considérablement de celle énoncée dans notre politique au moment où nous avons recueilli ces renseignements auprès de vous, nous vous demanderons de faire un choix quant à leur utilisation ou leur divulgation par des moyens appropriés, qui pourraient inclure un mécanisme de retrait.\n\nVoir les changements récemment apportés à la politique de protection de la vie privée",

Er gilt für Sie, wenn Sie sich für eine Stelle in der EU bewerben oder wenn Sie Interesse haben, Teil eines Talentnetzwerks zu werden. Weitere Informationen zur Verarbeitung Ihrer persönlichen Daten durch Verizon finden Sie in der Datenschutzerklärung von Verizon.\n\nWenn wir uns in dieser Datenschutzerklärung auf \"Verizon\" beziehen, meinen wir das Unternehmen Verizon, das Ihnen die Careers Website von Verizon (Verizon Communications, Inc.) zur Verfügung stellt, sowie jedes Unternehmen von Verizon, bei dem Sie sich um eine Stelle bewerben. Wenn Sie sich auf Positionen mit mehr als einem Verizon Unternehmen bewerben, wird jeder von ihnen als “Controller” Ihrer persönlichen Daten fungieren, da jeder von ihnen entscheidet, wie sie verwendet werden.\n\nWenn Sie Fragen zu diesem Hinweis haben oder wissen möchten, wie Verizon mit Ihren Daten umgeht, können Sie sich an das Privacy Team wenden über die Adresse emeadataprotection@intl.verizon.com.\n\n## Welche persönlichen Daten erheben wir direkt von Ihnen?\n\nWenn Sie ein Benutzerkonto auf der Careers Website von Verizon erstellen, werden Sie nach Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse und einem Passwort gefragt. So können Sie sich auf offene Stellen bewerben und den Status Ihrer Bewerbung verfolgen.\n\nWenn Sie sich für ein Verizon Talentnetzwerk registrieren, werden Sie im Lebenslaufformular nach Ihrem Namen, Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse und bestimmten anderen persönlichen Informationen gefragt.\n\nWenn Sie sich für eine Stelle bei einem Verizon Unternehmen bewerben, füllen Sie eine Online Bewerbung aus und geben persönliche Daten an, die zusätzliche Kontaktdaten (z. B. Postanschrift und Telefonnummer) sowie Informationen zu Ihrer Ausbildung, Erfahrung und Ihrem Werdegang enthalten können. Wir können Sie um zusätzliche persönliche Daten bitten, die uns bei unserem Rekrutierungsprozess unterstützen und falls Ihnen eine Stelle angeboten wird.\n\nSie werden eventuell auch gebeten, Verizon personenbezogene Daten anderer Personen mitzuteilen. Beispielsweise können wir Sie bitten, die Kontaktinformationen Ihres früheren Arbeitgebers anzugeben, damit Verizon Ihre bisherigen Erfahrungen bestätigen kann. Unter diesen Umständen müssen Sie diese Personen um Erlaubnis bitten, ihre persönlichen Daten an uns weiterzugeben und sie gemäß dieser Datenschutzerklärung zu verwenden. Ihr früherer Arbeitgeber könnte Sie um Ihre Bestätigung bitten, dass er Informationen mit Verizon teilen kann.\n\nWir werden auch einige Informationen von Ihnen automatisch sammeln, wenn Sie unsere Websites nutzen, einschließlich Daten, die mit Hilfe von Cookies und anderen Technologien zur Identifizierung von Geräten gesammelt wurden. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie wir diese Informationen verwenden, finden Sie in der Datenschutzerklärung.\n\nAls Teil des Online Rekrutierungsprozesses, der über die Careers Website von Verizon durchgeführt wird, fragen wir nicht nach speziellen Kategorien persönlicher Daten (z.B.

      "content": "# Data Processing Activities\n\n## Nature and purpose of personal data processing\n\nIn the course of providing products and services (“services”) to its customers, Verizon and its affiliates (“Verizon”), as well as its vendors and partners may need to process personal data as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy laws around the world. Article 28 requires Processors to provide detailed information to Controllers as to how their data will be processed. Article 30 also requires the Controller (with the assistance of its processors) to demonstrate how it will comply with the GDPR. The following information explains Verizon’s status under GDPR and similar privacy laws around the world and provides customers with further information regarding Verizon’s key services and the nature of processing where the GDPR or equivalent privacy laws are applicable.\n\n## When Verizon is a controller.\n\nVerizon processes personal data for administrative purposes in order to manage the relationship with its customers. This will include activities such as billing, installation, maintenance and customer service. In such circumstances Verizon is the Controller because it ‘determines the purpose and manner in which the data will be used’. Personal data processed for these administrative purposes will be retained in accordance with applicable law(s) and/or Verizon records retention policies unless otherwise stated in the customer agreement. For further information regarding the use of this data please contact emeadataprotection@intl.verizon.com.\n\nIn addition, in a limited set of circumstances Verizon may be considered a Controller in the course of providing services to customers. This will occur when Verizon is providing services where Verizon determines how the data should be processed in order to provide the service.\n\nExample: Verizon provides professional services to a customer in Belgium. This may include services such as managed security and on-premise security solutions. In such circumstances, it will be necessary for Verizon to process Customer Data. In doing so Verizon will determine how the data should be processed in order to provide the service requested.\n\n## When Verizon is a processor.\n\nIf GDPR applies, in most cases, when providing services to customers, Verizon will be a Processor. This means that Verizon will act on the instructions of the customer with regards to the personal data.\n\nExample: Verizon provides managed hosting services to its customer in Italy. The customer collects personal data about its end users and employees which Verizon stores on its behalf. In the course of providing such services Verizon may access this data and is a Processor on behalf of the customer.\n\n## Where GDPR does not apply.\n\nThere will be circumstances where GDPR does not apply. This can be because the data used to provide the service is not included in the definition of personal data under Article 4 of GDPR, or because the nature of the services Verizon is providing is not considered Processing under Article 4 GDPR.\n\nExample: An EU based customer purchases network services from Verizon. Verizon does not have logical access to any customer data in connection with the services. Verizon is not considered a Processor as it is a ‘mere conduit’ of the data (Article 2(4) GDPR and Article 12 Directive 2000/13/EC).\n\nExample: An EU based customer purchases pure co-location services from Verizon in Amsterdam. The customer’s servers reside in Verizon’s data centre but Verizon provides only space, power, cooling, and physical security for the server. This is not considered processing under GDPR.\n\nWhere Verizon is a Processor, customers should understand what Verizon is doing with their personal data.\n\n## What are the categories of personal data?\n\nVerizon will process a limited amount of personal data when providing services to customers. This will include:\n\n- contacts of customers\n- customer’s employees\n- customer contractors\n\n## The nature of personal data.\n\nThe type of data processed by Verizon Enterprise Solutions will depend on the nature of the business. However, when processing data on behalf of its customers Verizon is likely to process: IP traffic; names; business email addresses; business telephone numbers.\n\nVerizon Connect will process additional types of personal data when providing services. This may include the following data elements that are necessary to provide telematics service: End user email address; IP address and geo-location data.\n\nIn addition, at a customer’s request Verizon Connect can collect other information including driver licence expiration details. Any additional information would be at the direction of the customer and will be specifically agreed in the contract.\n\n## International transfers\n\nVerizon processes data outside the EEA. Verizon has Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) approved as both a Controller and Processor. As a result, Verizon Enterprise Solutions and Verizon Connect may transfer personal data outside of the EEA consistent with Article 47 GDPR. Further information regarding Verizon’s BCRs can be found at the International Privacy Centre.\n\n## Data retention\n\nWhere a specific data retention period is not defined in the [tables below] for a service, the retention period may be agreed as part of the contractual negotiations on an individual customer basis and detailed in that contract.\n\n## Privacy contact details\n\nFor queries regarding data processing activities please e-mail or contact us in writing at the following address:\n\nJannine Aston\n\nInternational Data Privacy Office\n\nVerizon Legal Department\n\nRIBP Floor 1 Spur D Basingstoke Road\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nUnited Kingdom RG26DA\n\nPlease note that not all Verizon companies are required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for the purposes of Article 37 GDPR. This is due to the differing nature of the services that they provide. However, Verizon Connect is required to appoint a DPO and she can be contacted as described above.\n\nThere may also be other countries outside the EU that require a DPO to be appointed such as Brazil and for this purpose the same contact details are applicable.\n\n## Security\n\nPlease refer to the Verizon Security Summary for a description of the technical and organisational security measures that Verizon implements to comply with its obligations under Article 32(1).\n\nWhere additional security measures are necessary for particular services, these will be detailed in the customer’s contractual documentation.\n\n## Description of processing of personal data by Verizon for services as Processor for Customer – Article 28 GDPR\n\nPlease note that if you cannot find your service listed in the attached links you should contact your account team who can provide you with additional information where applicable.\n\nVerizon services processing details information\n\nVerizon Connect services processing details information\n\nFor further information regarding how Verizon will protect your data please see the Verizon International Privacy Policy",

      "content": "# Important wireless\n\nissues\n\nWe want you to always feel safe and secure while enjoying your Verizon Wireless service. That’s why we’d like to make you aware of the following important issues.\n\n-\n## Wireless Phone Security\n\nUnfortunately, no one can completely prevent loss or theft. Bad things sometimes happen. That said, we’ve come up with several steps you can take to reduce the chances of having your device – along with the personal data stored within it – lost or stolen. This section also includes information for reporting and replacing a lost or stolen device.\n\n### Help protect your device by following these simple suggestions:\n\nAlways be aware of your surrounding environment:\n\n- Use your phone discreetly if you feel you are in an unsafe area.\n- Never leave your phone unattended or visible in your parked car.\n- Take extra care during times when you could be distracted, such as when checking out at the store, when using public transportation, when going through airport security or when approached by a stranger on the street.\n\nMake sure you document your device's information, including make and model, serial number, and its unique identification number (the MEID or IMEI).\n\nInstall and update anti-theft software, which can be downloaded from your phone's app store.\n\nApps are available that will locate your device from any computer, lock your device to restrict access and sound an alarm to help you locate it.\n\nFor most Android devices, Verizon Wireless offers a Mobile Security application that provides these and other features.\n\n### Use passwords to protect your data:\n\nVerizon suggests adding a passcode, password or security swipe pattern to protect the personal information on your phone or tablet. You can do this through the Settings menu. Some of the latest models also offer fingerprint and/or face recognition to lock and unlock the device.\n\nIf using a password, create a password that is easy to remember but difficult for anyone else to guess. Don’t create passwords that contain:\n\n- Basic words that would be easy to guess, like 'password' or 'verizon'\n- Simple keyboard patterns like 'qwerty,' '111111' or '123456'\n- Names of significant others, children, pets, sports teams, hobbies, etc.\n- Any form of your first or last name, birth date, license plate number, telephone number, etc.\n- Titles of popular movies, books or songs\n\nAnd always practice good password security:\n\n- Never share your passwords with anyone, especially over the phone or through email.\n- If you must write your passwords down, don’t leave them where someone could discover them.\n- Don’t re-use passwords across different websites or devices.\n\n-\n## Lost or Stolen Phone\n\nEquipment protection can help you repair or replace your device if it's ever lost, stolen, damaged or defective after the manufacturer warranty expires.\n\n### What to do if your device is lost or stolen.\n\nFirst, try to locate your phone by calling it from another phone or by using the GPS locator if you have one installed. (You can download a GPS locater from your phone's app store.)\n\nIf you’re certain your phone has been lost or stolen:\n\n- Contact Verizon Wireless right away at 800.922.0204. Or, login to My Verizon to suspend service and report your lost or stolen device. You can also contact your local police department to report the theft.\n- If you have anti-theft software installed on your device, such as Verizon Mobile Security, use it to lock your device and wipe it of any sensitive information.\n- Change the passwords to any personal accounts you may have accessed from your device – these include any email, online banking, shopping and social networking accounts.\n- If you are enrolled in Total Mobile Protection Coverage or another Wireless Phone Protection program, contact Asurion customer service at 888.881.2622 to file an insurance claim.\n\n-\n## Emergency Alerts\n\nWe make it a priority to keep communities informed of imminent threats to safety – and to alert them to missing persons in their area – by using Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs).\n\nWEAs are free wireless notifications delivered to WEA-enabled mobile devices as part of a public safety system in conjunction with federal, state and local authorities.\n\n### What types of WEAs are there?\n\nThere are three types of WEAs:\n\n**Presidential Alerts:**These alerts issued by the president can include news of national concern.- I\n**mminent Danger Alerts:**These alerts can warn you of extreme weather or other threats to safety. **AMBER Alerts:**These alerts notify the community of abducted children or other missing persons who may potentially be sighted in the local area.\n\nYou may opt out of Imminent Danger and Amber Alerts through the Settings menu on your device, but you may not opt out of Presidential Alerts per federal mandate.\n\n-\n## Enhanced 911 (E911)\n\nEnhanced 911, also known as E911, allows Verizon to provide enhanced location information to emergency call takers so they can more effectively route calls for emergency assistance.\n\n### How does E911 work?\n\nThe E911 information we provide to public safety answering points does two things:\n\n-\nIt automatically delivers the 911 caller’s telephone number to the call-taker.\n\n-\nIt enables the call-taker to obtain an approximate location of the caller so they can dispatch emergency responders who are near that location.\n\n\nE911 works for all GPS-capable phones, including all wireless phones sold by Verizon Wireless since December 31, 2003.\n\nVerizon Wireless does not provide E911 service for calls placed through any third-party applications you may have downloaded to make voice calls. Refer to the terms of service for these apps to learn whether you can reach 911 when using them.\n\n### What are the limitations of E911?\n\nHere are some important points to keep in mind about the limitations of E911:\n\n-\nVerizon Wireless' E911 service works only where Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) have upgraded to Enhanced-911 capable equipment or systems.\n\n-\nBecause wireless phones can react to the environment – for example, due to weather conditions or surrounding terrain – the enhanced location information we provide to emergency call takers can’t guarantee a precise location.\n\n-\nIn some places, public safety call takers still rely solely on the caller's descriptions to locate and dispatch help to people in emergency situations.\n\n\n-\n-\n## Avoiding Potential Hearing Loss\n\nMisusing any portable audio device, including mobile phones, can impact your hearing and potentially lead to hearing loss.\n\n### Recommendations when using portable audio devices.\n\nProlonged exposure to loud sounds is the most common cause of preventable hearing loss.Some scientific research suggests using portable audio devices, like portable music players and wireless phones, at high volume settings for long durations may lead to permanent hearing impairments. These impairments may include noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus (a ringing in the ear), hypersensitivity to sound and distorted hearing. Individual susceptibility can happen regardless of headphone use.\n\nWe encourage you to follow these common-sense recommendations when using any portable audio device:\n\n- Set your device’s volume in a quiet environment and select the lowest volume at which you can adequately hear.\n- Don’t turn the volume up to block out noisy surroundings. If you choose to listen to your portable device in a noisy environment, use noise-canceling headphones to block out background environmental noise.\n- When using headphones, if you can’t hear people speaking near you or if someone sitting next to you can hear what you’re listening to, it’s too loud. Turn the volume down.\n- Limit your listening time. As the volume increases, less time is required before your hearing could be affected.\n- Avoid using headphones after exposure to extremely loud noises such as concerts that might cause temporary hearing loss. Temporary hearing loss might cause unsafe volumes to sound normal.\n- Do not listen at any volume that causes you discomfort. If you experience ringing in your ears, hear muffled speech or experience any temporary hearing difficulty after listening to your portable audio device, discontinue use and consult your doctor.\n\nLearn more from the American Academy of Audiology\n\nLearn more from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n\n-\n## Medical Devices\n\nUsing a wireless device near an implantable medical device, such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, can potentially cause interference with the medical device.\n\n### Guidelines for implanted medical devices.\n\nIf you have an implanted medical device, we recommend that you follow these guidelines when using wireless communications devices:\n\n- Always keep the phone or wireless device more than 6 inches from your implantable medical device when the wireless device is turned on.\n- Don’t carry your phone in a breast pocket.\n- When using a wireless phone, use the ear opposite the implantable medical device to minimize the potential for interference.\n- If you have any reason to suspect that interference is taking place, turn the wireless device off immediately.\n- Read and follow the directions from the manufacturer of your implantable medical device and reach out to your health care provider if you have additional questions.\n\n-\n## Radio Frequency Emissions\n\nWe pay close attention to issues related to radio frequency (RF) emissions and aim to keep our customers informed.\n\n### Radio frequency emissions research\n\nAs explained on our website and in the brochure provided with each new wireless phone, your wireless phone contains a radio transmitter and receiver, and emits RF energy during use. RF energy has been studied by scientists worldwide for many years, and research continues.\n\nWireless phones sold in the United States are subject to federal safety requirements and must be tested and certified for compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. If you're concerned about the effects of RF emissions, the link below provides answers to commonly asked questions about the health effects of wireless phones, tips for reducing your RF exposure and research highlights from other informative resources.\n\n-\n## Device Unlocking Policies\n\nIn order to mitigate theft and other fraudulent activity, newly purchased devices are “locked” to work exclusively on the Verizon network. We have separate device unlocking policies that cover postpay and prepaid devices, as well as special rules for deployed military personnel.\n\n“Unlocking” a device refers only to disabling software that would prevent a consumer from attempting to activate a device designed for one carrier’s network on another carrier’s network. Due to differing technologies, an unlocked Verizon Wireless device may not work – or may experience limited functionality – on another carrier’s network.\n\n### Postpay Device Unlocking Policy\n\nDevices that you purchase from Verizon are locked for 60 days after purchase. Devices that you purchase from our retail partners are locked for 60 days after activation. After 60 days, we will automatically remove the lock. Following the 60 day lock period, we do not lock our phones at any time.\n\n### Prepaid Device Unlocking Policy\n\nDevices that you purchase from Verizon and certain devices purchased from our retail partners are locked for 60 days after activation. After 60 days, we will automatically remove the lock. Following the 60 day lock period following device purchase, we do not lock our phones at any time.\n\nIf you purchase a 4G Phone-in-a-Box from our retail partners, you should review the back of the box to determine the lock period applicable to that device.\n\n### Unlocking Policy for Deployed Military Personnel\n\nIf you are a Verizon Wireless customer on active duty in the military and receive relocation orders outside of the Verizon Coverage Area, upon verification, you do have the option to suspend your line for Military deployment. Upon suspension, your device will only be unlocked after the account has been verified in good standing after 60 days of being active.\n\n**Updated on: January 23, 2025**",
