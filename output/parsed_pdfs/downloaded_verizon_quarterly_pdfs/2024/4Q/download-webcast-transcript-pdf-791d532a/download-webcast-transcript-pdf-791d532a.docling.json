This guidance is an all-in number that includes all of our growth initiatives. This includes incremental investments to deploy C-band to 80% to 90% of plan sites, accelerating our Fios expansion to up to 650,000 to open for sale locations and launching our fixed wireless MDU solution. As always, we will continue to look for opportunities to efficiently deploy capital."
