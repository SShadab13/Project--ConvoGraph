Can we talk a little bit more about the Q, the accounts, the number that you reported this quarter. I think it's the lowest that we've seen since the data I have going back to like 2016. And so the way that the Q is growing is by kind of a shrinking number of accounts, but putting more and more into those accounts. I'm guessing the second-line strategy is one of those strategies, but can you talk a little bit about what kind of duration durability this approach to growth has, or do we need to see accounts grow in order to believe that Verizon is really on the right growth path? Thanks.",

And I think you see the momentum in both gross adds and in net adds in the quarter, and it's very high-quality growth, both on the consumer and the business side. Business had a very strong quarter as well on volumes. And you also see the growth in fixed wireless access. We did 378,000 fixed wireless access net adds that continue to provide a tailwind for the service revenue. So we're trying to find that right balance of P&Q, and I think the results reflect that.",

And as we said in April, we expect free cash flow to have a similar shape to last year and built throughout the year. And we still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year as we described back in January within that framework. We see slightly more incremental pressure from cash taxes and offsetting that as the lower upgrades, and we'll have to see where that goes. But overall, the strong position and cash flow puts us in a position to pay down debt in the second half of 2024, and we're on track to do so.",
