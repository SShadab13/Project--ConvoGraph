So we are really trying to see that we have the right offer for our customer. And what is giving me confidence is that our gross adds is just continue to grow for us. So we have the right offering in the market, together with myPlan. Of course, fourth quarter is always a little bit higher on upgrades because that's normal seasonality. But in general, I see that our model is working, and this is both helping our customers with the right offerings. But not only that, it's helping us with the bottom line and the cash flow generation that we're very focused here at Verizon. And then on the C-Band, we see the same things as we have discussed before. We see lower churn where we deploy C-Band. We see better step-ups in those regions. And then on top of it, we increased fixed wireless access so there's no difference on that. So I think we -- same thing. And that's why we're so excited by C-band continue to roll out, and we have gotten hold of the all C-Band here just a couple of weeks ago.",

So we have the right offering in the market, together with myPlan. Of course, fourth quarter is always a little bit higher on upgrades because that's normal seasonality. But in general, I see that our model is working, and this is both helping our customers with the right offerings. But not only that, it's helping us with the bottom line and the cash flow generation that we're very focused here at Verizon. And then on the C-Band, we see the same things as we have discussed before. We see lower churn where we deploy C-Band. We see better step-ups in those regions. And then on top of it, we increased fixed wireless access so there's no difference on that. So I think we -- same thing. And that's why we're so excited by C-band continue to roll out, and we have gotten hold of the all C-Band here just a couple of weeks ago."

That would be enterprise, public sector and small, medium business, and that performance is in a very uncertain environment. And as Hans said, strong results validate that businesses continue to trust the Verizon network, even during uncertain economic times. And we do see certain pressures in certain sectors, and we're certainly not immune to it, but we're not seeing anything significant. And from a competitive standpoint, I would tell you that we're being very disciplined and we're not going to chase bad deals that are unprofitable. The other thing I would mention is FWA volumes also continue at a strong pace in Business, and we had 132,000 net adds in the third quarter and over 400,000 year-to-date.

I think on a fixed wireless access, what I've said a couple of times now, we like to read them on 400,000 per quarter because it's putting our sort of our operations in the right mode of deploying this. And as we have also decentralized or regionalized our go-to-market, we can work with the markets where we actually open for sale fixed-wireless access, work with the local community, work with the local government and also address it through our stores. We can focus our efforts in that region and see that we capture all the demand and the funnel we have there. So we think it's a good model that we have right now. And then also, there are some laws of physics, how quickly we can roll out the C-Band. But I can tell you, there's no one holding back any investments here in order to get the C-Band to our customers as soon as possible. So I think we will continue to look at that, I mean, that type of levels going forward as well. And that will help us with reaching any goalposts we have or whatever goalposts were are communicating to the market.",
