I mean, let me say that on the fixed wireless access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the ILEC because that's just how it is because the Fios is so strong. So we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you have seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before, we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So Fios is doing really well."

We also saw that we now are doing some great work on how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we're managing our network is going great. And of course, as an ambitious leader, as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's the forecast we have, 4 million to 5 million. And we are really doing well. And the customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so simple. You install it yourself. You get broadband immediately."
