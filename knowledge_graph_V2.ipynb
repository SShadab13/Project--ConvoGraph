       "   'content': 'Powered by Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband, automated industrial machinery is expected to become smarter, more nimble and, ultimately, safer.\\n\\nFrom the assembly line to the fulfillment center, automated machinery already plays a vital role in industrial processes. That kind of factory automation, however, is just the tip of the articulated robotic arm.\\n\\nThe advent of 5G has the potential to drive a massive change in digitized operations, opening up a broad playbook of all-new robotic applications and having a transformative impact on everything from production to inventory management to warehouse logistics.\\n\\n“There’s no area more prepared for positive 5G disruption than the manufacturing industry,” confirms Thierry Sender, director of IoT and real-time enterprise product strategy at Verizon. “5G should deliver never-before-seen enhancements and improvements to all aspects of industry.”\\n\\nAn ultra-fast, low-latency network should help enable robots to become fully integrated pieces of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A next-gen network also has the potential to radically increase the viability of augmented and virtual reality on the factory floor, changing the way robots and humans work together. Ultimately, robotics in the age of 5G can make operations more efficient while also improving worker safety and the bottom line.\\n\\n## By the numbers: 5G and robotics\\n\\n1 International Federation of Robotics\\n\\n2 World Economic Forum\\n\\n3 Future of Jobs Report 2018, World Economic Forum\\n\\n4 Extraordinary Future via Visual Capitalist\\n\\nRapid factory reconfiguration\\n\\nRarely is a factory floor a static patch of real estate. Massive machinery must be repositioned regularly to account for shifts in scheduling and production. These changeovers can be literally a heavy lift — and that’s before factoring in proximity to fixed power sources or precision recalibration.\\n\\nBut with 5G, industrial robots have the potential to get smaller, lighter and easier to move from A to B. With 5G, less computing power is needed aboard a robot because complex functions can be performed on nearby servers, with negligible impact on machine responsiveness. This means clunky processors and giant batteries can be stripped from robots, reducing their form factors and drastically increasing their mobility. In some cases, a piece of machinery that was previously tethered to an electrical outlet may be freed to move nimbly around the floor—even autonomously.\\n\\nWhen factories can be retooled efficiently, production uptime can increase. More importantly, limiting the movement of heavyweight equipment reduces the risk of worker injury.\\n\\nComputing on the fly\\n\\nUnmanned aerial vehicles, or AEVs, already perform inventory management functions in large warehouses, but with 5G, their operational value to organizations could soar.\\n\\nPicture a drone buzzing through a fulfillment center, scanning barcodes, recording the location of products to be retrieved and shipped. The drone moves from shelf to shelf, row to row, storing data that will eventually be downloaded onto a central server and algorithmically analyzed so that scheduling and restocking decisions can be made. By any measure, this is quite a feat, something scarcely imaginable even a decade ago.\\n\\nProvided with a next-gen network, however, drones are expected to more seamlessly incorporate artificial intelligence into their routines, and instead of scanning barcodes, they should identify entire products at a glance using computer vision, processing gathered information in near-real time using cloud-based applications. Valuable time won’t be wasted waiting for the drone to dock and upload its cache of data. Rather, it will be sent over the air. And because the onboard compute and battery power have been minimized, the drones themselves can shrink.\\n\\nThe anticipated benefits: more decision-making power essentially in real time, lower product loss and a 360-degree, always-on view of stock, from check-in to ship out.\\n\\n“There’s no area more prepared for positive 5G disruption than the manufacturing industry. 5G should deliver never before seen enhancements and improvements to all aspects of industry.”\\n\\n— Thierry Sender, director of IoT and real-time enterprise product strategy at Verizon\\n\\nRobot patrol\\n\\nFrom automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, rolling through the production floor using computer vision, to autonomous industrial lift trucks relying on equal parts strength and artificial intelligence, mobile robotics are predicted to fundamentally change the way humans and goods navigate a busy workspace.\\n\\nConsider a worker using a forklift to move a stack of nestable pallets. Unforeseen obstacles or misoperation can lead to damaged product or machinery, or worse yet, serious injury. But with 5G, autonomous vehicle technology can put the forklift in constant sensor contact with its surroundings, adding precision to its path and minimizing human error. In some cases, workers won’t need to be behind the wheel at all, instead relying on augmented and virtual reality —technologies that are expected to become truly viable with the speed and low latency of 5G—to guide machines from remote locations.\\n\\nAGVs can also “know” more about what they’re hauling—what it is, where it needs to go and how best to get it there—so companies can maintain secure custody chains and avoid costly write-downs owing to misplaced inventory.\\n\\nNo-code machine reprogramming\\n\\nTraining a human worker to perform a new task can be time-consuming, but training a robot to take on a new job can be virtually impossible. 5G network technology, however, can provide some companies with a unique way of expanding the capabilities of their robotic forces. Using augmented reality and artificial intelligence, robots should become more adaptable.\\n\\nBeing able to simply tell a robot what to do and rely on it to figure out how—repurposing a depalletizing tool to assist in physical inspection, for instance—will be a gamechanger for many industries. In addition to the obvious cost benefits, companies can accelerate redeployments, optimize workflows and get the most out of their employees.\\n\\nAs these technologies demonstrate, advanced automation may ultimately change the nature of what humans are responsible for on the job site.\\n\\nThe future is 5G\\n\\n5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. But users will know it as one of the fastest, most robust technologies the world has ever seen. That means not only quicker downloads, but also richer immersive experiences that have a massive impact on how we live, work, learn and play. The connectivity benefits of 5G will make businesses more efficient and give consumers access to more information faster than ever before. Autonomous cars, smart communities, industrial IoT, remote healthcare—they all will rely on 5G.\\n\\n“We talk about 5G as the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” says Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg. “What we are doing is transformational. Here at Verizon, we not only have the best network for today, but also for tomorrow. It’s why we always say: We don’t wait for the future. We build it.”\\n\\nIs your business ready for 5G?\\n\\nOur 5G assessment and technology adoption tool will help you see how ready you are.

Services and Definitions**. The term \"Service\" shall mean any Verizon Internet access service based on digital subscriber loop (DSL) technology including services marketed under the Basic Internet, Business Internet or DSL name with or without local service (collectively \"Basic Internet Service\"), any Verizon Internet access service delivered over a fiber optic transmission facility including services marketed as Verizon Fios Internet Service (\"Fios Service\") and the \"Value Added Services\" which may be made available to you for a separate charge or included with your Basic Internet Service or Fios Service as set forth in Attachment A hereto. If a Value Added Service is included with Basic Internet Service, Fios Service or, for example, with the rental of a particular router, and you cancel your Basic Internet Service, Fios Service or router rental, then you will no longer be entitled to receive the Value Added Service that had been so included and Verizon can terminate the Value Added Service, including without limitation deleting any data or software associated with the Value Added Service. The Service includes all Software (as defined in this Agreement), Content, domain name server (DNS), and related services (including functionality that enables the delivery of Verizon messages to your internet browser), Verizon Web Sites and such other Verizon products or services as you may subscribe to with Verizon. The Service shall also include any software or hardware that we provide you in connection with the Service to which you have subscribed and any sub- or secondary accounts associated with a primary account. \"Content\" shall mean content provided by Verizon or its third party licensors, providers or suppliers and accessible on the Service, including without limitation images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, and text, with the exception of content uploaded by and stored on behalf of users. \"Verizon Web Site(s)\" mean the sites located at verizon.com/business and business.verizon.com which are comprised of various web pages, tools, information, software, Content, and features operated by Verizon. \"Bundled Service(s)\" means a combination or \"bundle\" of Basic Internet Service or Fios Service with one or more other eligible Verizon services, including but not limited to Verizon Fios TV and voice telephone service. \"Equipment\" means any Verizon owned asset that Verizon provides to customer for use with the Service. Equipment may be either rented to Customer or provided to Customer at no additional charge, and may include, without limitation, routers, extenders or modems along with any software contained in or downloaded to such Equipment as part of the Service. At Verizon’s option, Equipment may be required to be returned to Verizon upon termination or cancellation of Service.

The term “Retired” means any Equipment which Verizon explicitly identifies as Retired or no longer supported or required to be returned to Verizon. You are not required to return to Verizon any devices, such as routers, that have been designated as Retired. A list of Retired devices can be found at verizon.com/biz. The term \"Service Location(s)\" refers to the physical location(s) at which the Service has been installed.\\n\\n**2 Term; Changes to Service.**\\n\\n**a. Term and Termination. **This Agreement shall be effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement, as provided above, and shall continue until you or we terminate this Agreement as permitted herein. If you subscribe to a plan with a minimum term commitment (a \"Term Plan\"), you agree to maintain your Service or Bundled Service for the duration of that Term Plan, including any renewal Terms, if applicable. Your Term Plan begins on the later of: (a) the date you change your existing Service plan to a Term Plan; or (b) the date provisioning of your Service is complete (\"Service Ready Date\"), which will be the due date established by Verizon (after the Equipment has been delivered) if you are self-installing the Service; for Bundled Services, your Term Plan begins once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. You will begin receiving any Term Plan or other discount associated with a Bundled Service plan once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. Depending on the plan selected, your Term Plan will either expire at the end of the initial minimum term commitment period or will automatically renew for the same number of months as the initial minimum term commitment period (a \"renewal Term\"). If a Term Plan expires, your Service will continue and automatically convert to month-to-month rates that may be higher than Term rates. If you subscribe to a Term Plan with automatic renewals, your Term Plan will renew after each initial and renewal Term at then-current Term rates unless you or we cancel the renewal by contacting the other within the 30 day period before or the 60 day period after the renewal date. When you select a Term Plan, the monthly rates, minimum term periods, renewal terms, early termination fee and other terms of that plan will also apply and become part of this Agreement. In the event you change Service or Bundled Service plans, your monthly rate and term commitment may change (depending on the plan you select); otherwise, the terms of this Agreement will remain in effect unless otherwise provided. We reserve the right to terminate the Service (or any part thereof) in the event we cease to offer the Service generally or to your location. If we cease offering the Service (or any part thereof), we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice.\\n\\n**b. Changes to Service. **WWe reserve the right to change the Service (or any part thereof), at any time with or without notice to you. If such a change materially and adversely affects your use of the Service, and we cannot reasonably mitigate the impact, then, as your sole and exclusive remedy, you may terminate the Service without further obligation.\\n\\n**c. Changes to Local Voice Telephone Service.** If you change or discontinue your local telephone service, we may in our discretion either terminate your Service or continue to provide Service without Verizon local voice service at the then-current rates, terms and conditions applicable to your new Service plan, and you agree to pay any new or higher monthly fee that may apply to your new Service plan. If we elect to terminate your Service under this Section 2 (c) then we reserve the right to charge any applicable early termination fees and to apply the Equipment return terms set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n**d. Move/Down-grade/Up-grade Order Change Activities and Associated Fees.** You may down-grade speed connections within your selected Service plan or, subject to facilities availability, move your existing Service or phone line to another qualified Service or phone line for no additional charge; your Term Plan will not be altered as a result of such change order activity. In the event you up-grade to a Bundled Service plan, a new term commitment (depending on the plan you select) will apply starting on the effective date of your new Bundled Service plan. In the event you up-grade speed connections within your selected Service plan, additional charges may apply, subject to the terms and conditions for the new Service plan.\\n\\n**e. Conversion from Basic Internet Service to Fios Service**. Service is available on a limited basis based on your service address. Fios Service uses special fiber optic transmission facilities provided by your local Verizon telephone company. When Verizon is able to provision Service utilizing fiber optic technologies, we may in our discretion terminate your Basic Internet Service and cease offering Basic Internet Service to your location. In such case, we will offer you Fios Service at the then applicable rates and terms, which may differ from your previous Basic Internet Service rates and terms. As your sole and exclusive remedy, you may terminate the Service without further obligation.\\n\\n**3. Prices/Billing.** For any Service or Bundled Service, we will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice of a price increase in the manner set forth in Section 8 below or by United State Mail, email to your email address on file with us, or by notice on or with your bill. Prices for Term Plan Services are guaranteed until the expiration or next renewal date of the Term Plan, as applicable, subject to the provisions of this section. A price change shall not apply to a Term Plan until the next renewal date following the notice of the price change. Your continued use of the Service or Bundled Service after a price change is effective constitutes your acceptance of the price change. If you change your Service or Bundled Service or your Term Plan, you agree to pay the applicable monthly fee that may apply to your new Term Plan. You agree to pay all charges associated with the rate plan selected, including but not limited to a) applicable taxes, b) surcharges, c) Federal Universal Service Fund, tax and other recovery fees, d) telephone charges, e) activation fees, f) installation fees, g) setup fees, h) equipment charges, i) technician dispatch fees; j) early termination fees, and k) other non-recurring charges. Notwithstanding the pricing guarantee set forth above, the taxes, fees and other charges detailed in this section a) - d) may vary on a monthly basis; any variation will be reflected in your overall monthly charge. The amounts and what is included in such charges are subject to change. You also agree to pay any additional charges or fees applied to your billing account for any reason, including but not limited to interest and charges due to insufficient credit or insufficient funds. Activation fees, installation fees, setup fees, equipment charges, and other non-recurring charges, if applicable, will be included in your first month\\'s bill. You acknowledge that you may also incur data charges or fees from a wireless or internet service provider (which may be Verizon or a third party) for accessing online services or purchasing products and services through interactive options available through the Service. You are solely responsible for all charges or fees payable to Verizon and third parties, including all applicable taxes, and you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to third parties in connection with such transactions. Monthly Service and Bundled Service recurring charges will be billed one month in advance. Billing for Service(s) will automatically begin on the Service Ready Date unless you are notified otherwise by Verizon. We may, at our election, waive any fees or charges. You will begin receiving any discount associated with a Bundled Services plan once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. Verizon or its agent will bill you directly, or bill your credit or debit card or your local Verizon telephone bill (where available in selected areas only), as you request and as approved by Verizon. IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED FOR YOUR SERVICE ON YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, VERIZON WILL CONTINUE TO BILL THE CARD UNTIL YOU TELL US TO CANCEL SUCH BILLING, AND YOU ALSO AGREE THAT VERIZON MAY RECEIVE UPDATED CARD INFORMATION FROM YOUR CARD ISSUER. IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED FOR YOUR SERVICE ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL, BY USING THE SERVICES YOU AGREE TO HAVE VERIZON CHARGES INCLUDED ON YOUR PHONE BILL. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN THAT INCLUDES PHONE SERVICE, THEN ALL OF THE SERVICES INCLUDED IN THE BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN MUST BE BILLED ON YOUR PHONE BILL. If you cancel any component of a Bundled Services plan, the monthly charges for the remaining services on your account will automatically convert to the applicable existing, non-discounted month-to-month service rate. You may only take advantage of one promotional pricing offer during any consecutive twelve-month period. Eligibility for promotional offers may be contingent upon payment of all outstanding Verizon charges. If you enroll in Verizon\\'s Paperless Billing program, you agree to view and pay your bill electronically each month and to promptly update your e-mail address with Verizon if it changes. You will no longer receive a paper bill. Instead, each month you will receive an e-mail notifying you that your bill is available online for viewing and payment at verizon.com/business/login. You must continue to pay your paper bill until you receive your first e-mail notification that your bill is available online. If your electronic payment is rejected for any reason, Verizon may charge a return item fee (where permissible), cancel your enrollment in the Paperless Billing program and resume sending you paper bills.\\n\\n**4. Payment, Late Fee and Consent Regarding Credit.** We will invoice you monthly or on a prepaid basis, as applicable. Payment to Verizon is due upon receipt of invoice and shall be made in U.S. currency. A payment received thirty (30) calendar days or more after the invoice date is considered past due. If your charges are billed by your Verizon local carrier, the Late Fee will be equal to the late payment charge that the local exchange carrier applies. If your charges are not billed by your Verizon local carrier, you agree to pay interest at the rate set forth on your bill (or the maximum interest allowed by law, whichever is less). Verizon may assign unpaid delinquent charges to a collection agency for action. In the event Verizon utilizes a collection agency or takes legal action to recover monies due, you agree to reimburse Verizon for all expenses incurred to recover such monies (including attorney\\'s fees). We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing Service. In order to establish an account with us and/or obtain or modify Service, we may obtain a report from a credit agency or exchange information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness. If you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to credit reporting agencies which will negatively affect your credit report. You may be given the option to select a prepaid service plan (\"Prepaid Service Plan\") which will begin on the later of (a) the date of your order, or (b) the date you change to the Prepaid Service Plan. There will be no refunds for Prepaid Service Plans. At the end of any Prepaid Service Plan, you may be given the option to select a new Prepaid Service Plan. If you do not select a new Prepaid Service Plan, your Service will automatically convert to the then-current month-to-month rate.\\n\\n**5. Refundable Deposit. **We may require that you provide us with a refundable deposit, which will be specified at the time of your order (\"Subscriber Deposit\"). We may also require an additional deposit after activation of the Service if you fail to pay any amounts when due. Within ninety (90) days after termination of your Service, we will return your Subscriber Deposit, less any unpaid amounts due on your account, including any amounts owed for unreturned or damaged Equipment. Amounts held on deposit will not accrue interest except as required by law.\\n\\n**6. Renewal and Cancellation; Money Back Guarantee, and Early Termination Fee. **\\n\\n**a. Renewal or Cancellation**. Upon expiration or cancellation of the Term Plan, we may continue to provide you with Service on a month-to-month basis, at our then-current monthly price. You may contact us to subscribe to another available Term Plan at then-current Term rates. If you subscribe to an automatic renewal Term Plan, your Term Plan will automatically renew at the end of the initial Term and at the end of each successive renewal Term, at the then-current Term rates, unless you contact us to cancel within 30 days before or 60 days after the renewal date. Verizon will provide you a reminder before each renewal date. If you wish to cancel your Service or renewal, or wish to select another plan, you may do so by calling 1-800-VERIZON (800-837-4966).\\n\\n**b. Money Back Guarantee. **If we provide a money-back guarantee (\"MBG\") for your Service, it will begin when billing for your Service starts. During any applicable MBG period you may cancel the Service and receive a full refund of all monthly charges paid as well as any one-time charges and Equipment charges paid to Verizon (provided you return all Equipment in good working condition). An early termination fee will not apply to Service terminated within a MBG period, if one is provided. A MBG, if applicable, will not apply if you change between or renew service plans. You are limited to a maximum of one MBG per Service type per Service address.\\n\\n**c. Early Termination Fee.** Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, if Service provided pursuant to a Term Plan is removed or terminated by you (or by us if you breach this Agreement) before you have completed the then-current initial or renewal Term, then you agree to pay Verizon the early termination fee set forth in the pricing plan you have chosen. It is agreed that Verizon\\'s damages, if you cancel your Service, are difficult or impossible to ascertain; therefore, the provisions of this Section are intended to establish liquidated damages in the event of cancellation and are not intended as a penalty. In addition, if you cancel Service after any applicable MBG period, you agree to pay us all Service fees accrued as of the cancellation date.\\n\\n**7.

These security measures may include but are not limited to, the use of firewalls and blocklists to block potentially harmful or abusive emails or attachments, anti-spam filters, anti-virus or anti-spyware software, or blocking selected ports. Such activities may result in the blocking, filtering or non-delivery of legitimate and non-legitimate email sent to or from your email account.

Termination by you will be effective on the last day of that month’s billing cycle, and you are responsible for all charges incurred through that date. Installation or set-up fees paid at the initiation of the Service, if any, are not refundable. Termination by us will be effective on the last day of that month’s billing cycle, and you are responsible for all charges incurred through that date. Upon termination for any reason, you will be responsible for payment of all outstanding account balances and charges accrued through the date of termination, and, if such termination is by you, any applicable early termination fee. If a termination is a result of violation by you of the terms of this Agreement, you may also be liable to pay an early termination fee. We reserve the right, but assume no obligation, to suspend performance immediately if you are more than thirty (30) calendar days overdue in payments or if, in our reasonable judgment, you have violated any provision of this Agreement, including our AUP. We may, at our sole discretion, refuse to accept your subsequent request for Service following a termination or suspension of your use of the Service. If your Service is terminated for any reason, you may be required to pay a reconnection fee or additional deposit before the Service is reactivated.\\n\\n**15. Monitoring of System Performance.** Verizon automatically measures and monitors network performance and the performance of your Internet connection in order to improve the level of Service. Verizon also will access and record information about your computer\\'s settings in order to provide customized technical support. You agree to permit us to access your computer\\'s settings in order to provide customized technical support. You agree to permit us to access your computer, Equipment and any other equipment used to provide or receive the Service and to monitor, adjust and record such data, profiles and settings for the purpose of providing the Service. You also consent to Verizon\\'s monitoring of your Internet connection and network performance, and to our accessing and adjusting your computer, Equipment and any other equipment settings, as they relate to the Service, Software, or other services, which we may offer from time to time. Verizon does not share information collected for the purpose of network or computer performance monitoring or for providing customized technical support outside of Verizon or its authorized vendors, contractors and agents.\\n\\n**16.

Resolution of Disputes.**\\n\\n**a.** The parties desire to resolve disputes arising out of this Agreement without litigation. Accordingly, except for action seeking a temporary restraining order or injunction related to the purposes of this Agreement, or suit to compel compliance with this dispute resolution process, the parties agree to use the following alternative dispute resolution procedure as their sole remedy with respect to any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its breach. The parties further agree that this Agreement does not permit class arbitration, even if the procedures or rules of the American Arbitration Association (or other dispute resolution organization or body) would otherwise permit it.\\n\\n**b.** At the written request of a party, each party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The parties intend that these negotiations be conducted by non-lawyer, business representatives. The location, format, frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may mutually agree to utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as confidential information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any lawsuit without the concurrence of all parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications that are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.\\n\\n**c.** If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of the initial written request, and the amount in controversy exceeds five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars or the jurisdictional limit for small claims court in the jurisdiction in which service is provided (whichever is less), the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. A party may demand such arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in those rules. Discovery shall be controlled by the arbitrator and shall be permitted to the extent set out in this section. Each party may submit in writing to a party, and that party shall so respond, to a maximum of any combination of twenty-five (25) (none of which may have subparts) of the following: interrogatories, demands to produce documents and requests for admission. Each party is also entitled to take the oral deposition of one (1) individual representing another party. Additional discovery may be permitted upon mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitration hearing shall be commenced within sixty (60) calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in the county where Service is provided to you by Verizon. The arbitrator shall control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The parties may submit written briefs. The arbitrator shall rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of hearings. The times specified in this section may be changed upon mutual agreement of the parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\\n\\n**d. **If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) calendar days of the initial written request, and the amount in controversy does not exceed five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars or the jurisdictional limit for small claims court in the jurisdiction is which service is provided (whichever is less), the dispute may be submitted to small claims court in the jurisdiction in which service is provided for resolution in accordance with its rules and procedures.\\n\\n**e. **Each party shall bear its own costs of these procedures.

INTRODUCTION **\\n\\nTHIS SERVICES AGREEMENT (the “Agreement” and/or “Terms and Conditions”), as amended from time to time by Web.com Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns (the terms “Web.com,” “us,” “we” and/or “our” shall refer to Web.com), between you (the terms “Customer,” “you” and/or “your” shall refer to the individual, entity or organization that accepts this Agreement, has access to your account or uses the Services) and Web.com, sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your purchase and/or use of our products and services (collectively, the \"Services\") as further set forth herein. You and Web.com together may be referred to herein as the “Parties” and each may be referred to herein as a “Party.” This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us in relation to any Services you purchase or otherwise utilize.\\n\\nYou acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by all of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, as well as all other applicable rules or policies, terms and conditions, or service agreements that are or may be established by Web.com from time to time and are incorporated herein by reference. You may also elect to purchase additional Services (the “Additional Services”) from Web.com, our partners and/or other third parties, which may have their own service agreements or other related terms and conditions, and it is your obligation to review, accept and abide by those service agreements or other related terms and conditions, as well as this Agreement.\\n\\nWeb.com agrees to comply in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) to the extent applicable to Web.com and to the extent Web.com is storing, processing, or transmitting any “Cardholder Data” or “Sensitive Authentication Data” (as those defined under the PCI-DSS) in connection with the Services.\\n\\n**2. SERVICES **\\n\\nThis Agreement applies to all Services, whether purchased or utilized separately or as part of a complete solution or packaged bundle. Your purchase of the Services, continued use of the Services, and/or continued access to the Services constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement. If you purchase Services that are sold together as a “bundled” package (e.g., you purchase a package that includes both a domain name and a website builder or other Services, as opposed to your purchasing such Services separately), termination of any part of the Services will result in the termination of all Web.com Services provided as part of the bundled package. See Section 4 (Termination) for additional details on this subject. Web.com further reserves the right to modify the Services, at our sole and absolute discretion, either temporarily or permanently, at any time or from time to time, with or without notice to you. You agree that Web.com shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such modification of the Services and that your continued use of the modified Services, and/or continued access to the modified Services, constitutes your acceptance of any such modifications.\\n\\nYou acknowledge and agree that some or all of the Services you purchase or receive from us may be provided by one or more vendors, contractors or affiliates selected by Web.com in its sole and absolute discretion. As a part of your Services, Web.com may provide you access to third-party functionality or services, including, but not limited to, applications, widgets, Rich Site Summary (“RSS”), other types of news, event and industry feeds, calculators, recommended copy, forms and templates that are incorporated or offered as a part of one or more of the Services (collectively, “Third-Party Functionality”). You acknowledge and agree that your use of any Third-Party Functionality to which you are provided access as part of any Web.com Services is in accordance with the terms of any relevant third-party licenses, agreements and/or terms and conditions. Your failure to abide by any such third- party licenses, agreements and/or terms and conditions may result in the immediate termination of your Services provided by Web.com. You understand and agree that Web.com does not control such Third-Party Functionality and is therefore not liable to you or any third party for any issues of any kind relating to issues relating to Third- Party Functionality. Web.com reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate, suspend, cancel or alter your access to Third-Party Functionality at any time and without notice to you.\\n\\n**3. FEES AND PAYMENTS, TERM & RENEWALS **\\n\\nAs consideration for the Services you purchase, order or otherwise utilize, you agree to pay Web.com all applicable prices and fees as designated in the related order process, with such prices and fees subject to change as provided in this Agreement. All prices and fees are due immediately or upon ordering and are non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, as required by applicable law, or as such prices and fees are billed by Web.com under an invoice or order confirmation for Services issued to a Customer that expressly permits payment within thirty (30) days after Web.com has sent the Customer such invoice or order confirmation (\"Net-30 Customers\"). Web.com may require a Customer to successfully complete a credit application prior to such Customer qualifying to become a Net-30 Customer.\\n\\nIf you require Additional Services, then additional prices and fees will apply pursuant to then current rates, which are also subject to change in accordance with this Agreement. All quoted prices and fees exclude all applicable sales tax, use tax, value added tax (“VAT”), and other taxes and government charges, whether federal, state or foreign. You are responsible for payment of all such taxes (other than based on Web.com’s income), fees, duties and charges on your payment for the purchase of Services arising from any and all fees under this Agreement. Accordingly, you agree to pay all VAT, sales and other taxes (other than taxes based on Web.com income) related to Web.com services or payments made by you hereunder. All payments of prices and fees for Web.com Services shall be made in U.S. dollars. Although Web.com may display pricing in various currencies, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase. If the currency of your bank or credit card account is not in U.S. dollars, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank or credit card company. In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process; (ii) the time the transaction is processed; and\\n\\n(iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank or credit card, the conversion rates may fluctuate and Web.com makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank or credit card for payment will be the same amount that is posted to your bank or credit card statement or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank or credit card statement, and you agree to waive any and all claims against Web.com based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing). You acknowledge and agree that you may be charged VAT based on the country indicated in the account holder’s address information associated with your account. Set up prices and fees, if any, will become payable on the applicable effective date for the applicable Services.\\n\\nUnless otherwise stipulated in the related order process, payment for the Services are to be made via a charge to your credit card, charge card, PayPal account or bank account provided to us (“the Account”). You are solely and absolutely responsible for any Account information that you provide to Web.com and must promptly inform Web.com of any changes or updates to the method of payment. By submitting an order for Services, you authorize Web.com to charge the order to the Account or to otherwise immediately bill you for the Services. You acknowledge and agree that unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the order process or otherwise changed afterwards in accordance with the applicable process, all annual, monthly or other recurring fees related to the Services or otherwise referenced in this Agreement are to be recurring transactions that will be billed on an ongoing basis until the Services are terminated in accordance with this Agreement. If you have provided billing information sufficient for automatic billing, then Web.com will bill you automatically in accordance with the applicable billing frequency. You are obligated to pay for the full amount of the Agreement, even if such full amount is scheduled to be paid in installments. If you elect to pay for the Services in installments, provided such a payment schedule is expressly permitted and accepted by Web.com, all installments must be received on or before the applicable due date. If you qualify, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, extend payment terms to you under our Business Account Credit Program.\\n\\nUnless otherwise specified herein, on our website or in the applicable order process, each Web.com Service is for a one-year initial term and renewable thereafter for successive terms. Any Web.com Service that provides for a monthly billing cycle may be billed every four (4) weeks. Any renewal of your Services with us is subject to our then current Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, successful completion of any applicable authentication procedure, and payment of all applicable service prices and fees at the time of renewal, and in the case of domain name re-registration, the domain name registry\\'s acceptance of your domain name registration. Upon prior notice, Web.com may also charge an “Account Maintenance Fee” to maintain your active account. This Account Maintenance Fee shall be billed to your account each year, thirty (30) days following the annual anniversary date of your account creation. Except with respect to the Services to which you subscribe on a monthly (or similar billing cycle) basis, we will endeavor, but are not obligated, to provide you with notice prior to the renewal of your Services at least fifteen (15) days prior to the renewal date.\\n\\nPricing for Services, renewals, and product upgrades and add-ons may vary based upon the date of your purchase. Additional payment terms may apply to the Services you purchase, as set forth in the applicable supplemental service and product agreements to this Agreement, on our website or as otherwise outlined in the applicable order process. Services to which you subscribe to on a monthly or recurring basis automatically renew on a recurring basis until the Agreement is properly terminated in accordance with its terms. We may, at any time, activate the auto-renew service for eligible Services in your account if it is not already activated. Further, we may provide you with an opportunity to opt-in to our automatic renewal process in accordance with the instructions (and subject to your agreement to the terms and conditions pertaining to that process) on our website or in the applicable order process. You agree that if you are enrolled in or otherwise utilizing our auto-renew service, we will attempt to renew your service at some point less than ninety (90) days prior to its expiration [without notice to you]. Such automatic renewal for your Services, if successful, may be for a shorter term than the term for which you originally purchased your Services, but in no event shall such term be longer than the term then currently in place for the Services. Such automatic renewal for your Services, if successful, shall be at the then current price for the Services. You further agree that, to turn off the auto-renew service for any of your Services with Web.com, you must call our Customer Service, or you may be able to turn off such auto-renew service utilizing the online Account Manager associated with your Services. You acknowledge and agree that the renewal price may be higher or lower than the price you paid for the then current term of the Services, and that we are authorized to charge your credit card or other payment method on file for the renewal of the Services. In any event, you are solely and absolutely responsible for the credit card or payment information you provide to Web.com and must promptly inform Web.com of any changes thereto (e.g., change of expiration date or account number). You acknowledge and agree that Web.com may extend the expiration date on your credit card on file with us in order to protect against unwanted expiration of your Services and to allow for the automatic renewal thereof. In addition, you are solely and absolutely responsible for ensuring the Services are renewed. Web.com shall have no liability to you or any third party in connection with the renewal as described herein, including, but not limited to, any failure or errors in renewing the Services whether due to you, us or a third party. In order to process a renewal under our auto-renew service, we may use third-party vendors for the purpose of updating the expiration date and account number of your credit card or other payment method on file. Such third-party vendors maintain relationships with various credit card issuers and may be able to provide us with the updated expiration date and account number for your credit card by comparing the information we have on file with the information the third-party vendor has on file. By selecting our auto-renew service, you acknowledge and agree that we may share your credit card or other payment method information with such third-party vendors for the purpose of obtaining any update to your credit card expiration date, account number or payment account.\\n\\nIn the event that you are not enrolled in auto-renew, or have opted out of auto-renew, and want to renew your Services, you acknowledge and agree you are responsible for actively renewing your Services and you further assume all risk and consequences if you wait until the end of the Services term or otherwise to attempt to renew any Services. If any Service is not successfully renewed prior to the expiration of its then current term, all your rights to such Service will terminate, and we will have no obligation to allow you to renew a Service once its expiration date has passed. Additionally, for domain name registration services, even if a registry administrator or third-party service provider provides a grace period to Web.com upon expiration or termination of such Service, you acknowledge and agree that any post-expiration renewal or redemption processes implemented on your behalf are at our sole and absolute discretion, and may be subject to a late fee, reinstatement fee, redemption fee and/or other fee.\\n\\nWithout limiting any of Web.com\\'s rights hereunder, should any fee payment become delinquent, Web.com may suspend or cancel your Services; provided, however, related charges will continue to accrue. You acknowledge and agree that Web.com is not responsible whatsoever for any effect the suspension of Services might have. If Web.com provides any Service discount to you and you default on payments or obligations as outlined herein, Web.com may rescind all discounts and require full payment for the Services. All sums due and payable that remain unpaid after any applicable cure period herein will accrue interest as a late charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less. Web.com further reserves the right to refer any amounts owed hereunder to a third party for collection in the event of default. In the event your account is sent to collection, you agree to pay all costs of collection, including costs, litigation and attorneys’ fees. A $20.00 (Twenty U.S. dollars) collection fee may be charged for all dishonored checks. Moreover, an additional fee may also be assessed for the following reasons: (i) late payment; (ii) payment with insufficient funds; (iii) denied or invalid credit card number; or (iv) the re-starting or reinstating of Services terminated for nonpayment. Web.com will re-start or reinstate any such Service in our sole and absolute discretion and subject to our receipt of the applicable service fee, renewal fee or other fee.\\n\\nIf Customer pays for the Services by credit card or charge card, Customer permanently and irrevocably waives any and all right to enact a ‘chargeback\\' (that is, a disputed, reversed or contested charge with the applicable bank, credit card, charge card or other payment method) against these payments for any reason whatsoever against Web.com. If for any reason Web.com is unable to charge your Account or other payment method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Web.com receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Account or other payment method, you agree that we may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including, but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any your Services (including domain names). We also reserve the right to charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing fees” for (i) additional tasks we may perform outside the normal scope of the Services; (ii) additional time and/or costs we may incur in providing the Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to: (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by Web.com staff or by outside firms retained by us; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Web.com as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or other payment method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Account or other payment method you have on file with Web.com.\\n\\nCUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT ALL WEB.COM FEES AND CHARGES ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THAT WEB.COM MAY CHANGE ANY PRICE, FEE, RATE OR PLAN AT ANY TIME UPON NOTICE TO CUSTOMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 26 (NOTICE) OF THIS AGREEMENT.\\n\\n**4. TERMINATION **\\n\\n**A.** **Generally.** Web.com may terminate this Agreement immediately for any or no reason and without notice to you. Without limiting the foregoing, Web.com reserves the right to suspend or terminate all Services immediately without notice to you if Web.com determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that you have failed to comply with your obligations as set forth in this Agreement. In the event of your chargeback by a credit card, charge card or other payment method, or other non-payment by you in connection with your payments of the applicable billing cycle fee, renewal fee or other applicable fee, you acknowledge and agree that all of your Services may be suspended, canceled or terminated, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice to you.\\n\\nUnless otherwise stipulated in the related order process, you may terminate this Agreement and the Services by calling Web.com Customer Service, whereby this termination request may be recorded, and the Services will terminate as of the end of the applicable, current billing period. You are responsible for all fees incurred up to and including the date of termination and upon termination you may receive a final bill reflecting the balance due for any remaining charges and agrees to pay all such fees incurred by you and/or via your utilization of the Services. If you order any Services by telephone and do not agree to be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions at that time, you must notify Web.com within seventy-two (72) hours from the time that Web.com has sent you a welcome e-mail to your account e-mail address on record, that you desire to cancel such Services, whereby the Services will be cancelled, and a refund of any payments or fees already paid to Web.com with respect to the order of the Services will be issued, with no further obligation by either Party. Your failure to notify Web.com of cancellation of any Services as described above will indicate that you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood these Terms and Conditions and agree to be legally bound by them.\\n\\nExcept as otherwise expressly set forth herein or on our website, Web.com will cease charging your credit card, if applicable, for any monthly service fees as of the expiration of the billing cycle in which the termination is effective. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Web.com, you will not receive any refund for payments already made by you as of the date of termination, regardless of whether any related Services have been performed, and you may also incur additional fees and/or be obligated to pay us for the balance of your term (in the case of a monthly or annual subscription being paid over time, as provided in various supplemental service and product agreements). If termination of this Agreement is due to your default hereunder, you shall bear all costs of such termination, including any reasonable costs Web.com incurs in closing your account and you further agree to pay any and all costs incurred by Web.com in enforcing your compliance with this Section. Upon termination, you must destroy any copy of the materials licensed to you hereunder and referenced herein. You agree that upon termination or discontinuance for any reason, we may delete all information related to you on the Service, if applicable. In addition to the terms set forth herein, certain Web.com Services may have additional terms regarding termination, which are set forth in the applicable supplemental service and/or product agreements. Moreover, should you or we cancel or terminate your Services at any time prior to the completion of the applicable term, such cancellation or termination may result in our application of an early termination fee charged to your account, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice to you.\\n\\n**B. Termination of Bundled Services.** In addition to the Terms and Conditions set forth herein, if you purchase Web.com Services which are sold together as a solution or bundled package of Services, any termination relating to any one such solution or bundled package will terminate all Web.com Services included in such solution or bundled package. For instance, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any domain name registered with or maintained by Web.com under this Agreement (but not including any domain names you may have registered, either with Web.com or a third-party registrar, separately and not as part of a bundled package) may be cancelled and may thereafter be available for registration by another party. You acknowledge and agree that upon any termination or cancellation of your solution or bundled package, the Terms and Conditions regarding transfer of expired domain names as described in this Service Agreement may apply.

ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.\\n\\nWeb.com disclaims any responsibility for any Content, goods and services sold by you or otherwise made available through your Website, or the quality or accuracy of any information on your Website. Web.com will not endorse, warrant, or guarantee any product or service offered through your Website, and will not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party purchasers of products or services offered through or resulting from the services or use of your Website, including, but not limited to, all sales of goods or services, credit card transactions, banking or securities transactions, or any business, service or merchandise agreements. Additionally, the Web.com website may contain links to other Internet websites or resources (including partner websites or third-party advertising on a Web.com website). You acknowledge and agree that neither Web.com nor any third party are responsible or liable in any way for (i) the availability or accuracy of linked websites or resources or (ii) the content, advertising or products on or available from such linked websites. The inclusion of any link on our website does not imply that Web.com or a third party endorses any of the linked websites, and you agree to use the links at your own risk.\\n\\nAdditionally, Web.com will not be liable to you for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages of any kind, (including, but not limited to, lost profits, goodwill, data, the cost of replacement goods or services, business interruption or other intangible losses), whether foreseeable or not, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, even if Web.com has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n\\nWeb.com’s aggregate liability shall not exceed the total amount paid by you for the Services, but in no event shall it be greater than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and you acknowledge and agree that this will be your exclusive remedy under this Agreement and otherwise in relation to your use of the Services. You agree that Web.com’s entire liability, in law, equity or otherwise, with respect to any Services provided under this Agreement and/or for any breach of this Agreement, is solely limited to the amount you paid for such Services during the term of this Agreement, except as otherwise limited herein. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states Web.com’s liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.\\n\\nYou acknowledge and agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of Web.com’s Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action initially arose or such claim or cause of action is permanently barred.\\n\\nYou further agree that any dispute or disagreement relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Services shall be resolved on an individual basis. As such you acknowledge and agree that you may not bring a claim that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or the Services as a plaintiff or a class member in a class action, a consolidated action or a representative action. You acknowledge and agree that class actions, representative actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other actions are not permitted.\\n\\nYou acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Section are an essential element of this Agreement and absent such limitations, Web.com would not enter into this Agreement or provide Services hereunder. Each Party acknowledges that it has not entered into this Agreement in reliance upon any warranty or representation except those specifically set forth herein.\\n\\n**13.

Customer’s failure to perform in accordance with this Agreement;\\n\\niii. Customer’s use of the Services;\\n\\niv. the Website, Content and/or URLs;\\n\\nv. Customer’s violation of any third-party rights; or\\n\\nvi. Customer’s application for and registration of, renewal of, or failure to renew a particular domain name.\\n\\nYou agree that this indemnification obligation survives this Agreement’s termination or expiration. You agree to give prompt, written notice to Web.com upon the receipt of notice of any claim by a third party against you which might give rise to a claim against Web.com, stating the nature and basis of such claim and, if ascertainable, the amount thereof.\\n\\nWhen Web.com is threatened with a lawsuit or is sued by a third party, Web.com may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify Web.com. Such assurances may, without limitation, be in the form of a deposit of money by you to Web.com or its representatives to cover Web.com ’s fees and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, in any such lawsuit or threat of suit. Your failure to provide such assurances shall be considered by Web.com to be a material breach of this Agreement. Web.com shall have the right to participate in any defense by you of a third-party claim related to your use of any of Web.com’s Services, with counsel of Web.com’s choice. Web.com shall reasonably cooperate in the defense at your request and expense.

Since Web.com exercises no control whatsoever over the information that is received abroad or by foreign nationals within the United States, you agree to comply with all export and import requirements as referenced herein. Since Web.com exercises no control whatsoever over the content of information passing through its Service, the entire burden of complying with all applicable laws and regulations is your obligation. You agree to comply with such applicable laws and regulations and to indemnify and hold Web.com harmless from any damages it may suffer resulting from any violation of the export control laws of the United States.\\n\\n**14. WAIVER **\\n\\nNo waiver of any provision of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Web.com. Web.com’s remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative, and the election of one remedy for a breach does not preclude pursuit of other remedies. The failure of Web.com to require your performance of any Agreement provision does not affect the full right to require such performance at any time in the future. The waiver by Web.com of any rights arising out of any breach of any Agreement provision shall not be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. Any failure by Web.com to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement or any applicable laws does not constitute a waiver of such right.\\n\\nNeither Party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than (i) by an authorized representative and (ii) in an explicit written waiver. No waiver of any rights arising out of a breach of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of rights relating to any prior or subsequent breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n**15. SEVERABILITY **\\n\\nYou agree that the terms of this Agreement are severable. If any term or provision is declared invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, that term or provision will not affect the remainder of this Agreement. This Agreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make this Agreement enforceable, valid and, to the maximum extent possible, consistent with applicable law and consistent with the original intention of the Parties; and the remaining terms and provisions will remain in full force and effect.\\n\\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, Web.com will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of Web.com as reflected in the original provision. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement does not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect.\\n\\n**16. FORCE MAJEURE **\\n\\nNeither Party is deemed in default hereunder, nor will it hold the other Party responsible for, any cessation, interruption or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement due to earthquake, flood, fire, storm, natural disaster, act of God, war, terrorism, armed conflict, labor strike, lockout or boycott, provided that the Party relying upon this Section takes all steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances to mitigate the effects of the force majeure event upon which such notice is based; provided further, that in the event a force majeure event described in this Section extends for a period in excess of thirty (30) days in the aggregate, Web.com may immediately terminate this Agreement and will have no liability therefrom.\\n\\n**17.

PRECIOS Y PAGO.**\\n\\nComo contraprestación de su recepción del Servicio y el uso de los Equipos u Otros Dispositivos, usted acepta pagarnos lo siguiente:\\n\\n(a) Cargos por el Servicio. La facturación del Servicio comenzará automáticamente: (i) Una vez instalado el Servicio si el Servicio es instalado por Verizon o (ii) en la fecha de vencimiento establecida por Verizon (luego de que se haya entregado el Equipo u Otros Dispositivos aplicables) en caso de que usted mismo haya instalado el Servicio. La facturación continuará hasta que el Servicio sea cancelado de conformidad con la Sección 10 (a) de este Acuerdo.. Una vez que hayan sido instalados todos los Servicios combinados, comenzará a recibir los descuentos asociados con un plan de Servicios combinados. Los cargos comunes por el Servicio y los Equipos (y, si corresponde, Otros Dispositivos) se facturan todos los meses de manera anticipada. Usted acepta pagarnos de manera anticipada, con la tarifa vigente en ese momento, durante todos los períodos hasta que finalice el Servicio de conformidad con la Sección 10 (a) de este Acuerdo. Otros cargos por transacciones, como para los servicios de On Demand o Pay Per View, se facturan luego de que usted haya pedido o recibido el servicio o la función correspondiente. También puede tener la obligación, sobre la base de su historial de pedidos y pagos, de realizar pagos antes de la facturación con tarjeta de crédito u otros métodos de pago que podamos designar para los servicios transaccionales tales como los servicios de On Demand o Pay Per View. Usted acepta pagar todos los cargos correspondientes para el Servicio y los Equipos u Otros Dispositivos antes de la fecha de vencimiento que se indica en la factura mensual.

Si cancela algún servicio del Plan de servicios combinados, los cargos mensuales de los servicios restantes en su cuenta se facturarán automáticamente con la tarifa de servicio mensual sin descuento aplicable al momento en que cancele el servicio.\\n\\n(b) Planes de tarifas con plazos mínimos. Si se suscribe a un plan de servicios combinados con un contrato por plazo, acepta mantener dichos servicios durante el plazo mínimo del plan. Al finalizar el plazo, es posible que tenga la posibilidad de elegir un nuevo plan de servicios combinados. Si no elige un nuevo plan de servicios combinados, su cuenta se convertirá automáticamente en un plan de servicio mensual con un cargo mensual que puede ser superior al de su tarifa actual. Si se suscribe a un nuevo plan de servicios combinados, se aplicarán los plazos de ese plan.\\n\\n(c) Cargos de terceros. Usted reconoce y acepta que puede incurrir en cargos con terceros que son distintos y aparte de los Cargos por el servicio que nosotros cobramos.

Si no paga a tiempo y Verizon remite su(s) cuenta(s) a terceros a fin de cobrarla(s), se aplicará un cargo por cobro que vencerá al momento de la derivación de la(s) cuenta(s) al tercero. El cargo se calculará al porcentaje máximo permitido por las leyes correspondientes que no excederá el 18 por ciento.\\n\\n(e) Depósito del cliente. Podemos solicitarle que proporcione un depósito reembolsable (“Depósito del cliente”) antes de la activación o reactivación del Servicio o luego de hacerlo. También podemos solicitar un Depósito del cliente adicional después de la activación del Servicio si usted no paga un importe a su vencimiento de acuerdo con el presente documento o si pretende actualizar su Servicio. Aplicamos Depósitos del cliente contra los importes no pagados en cualquier momento. Dentro de los noventa (90) días de la finalización del Servicio, nosotros devolveremos una suma equivalente al Depósito del cliente, sin intereses, excepto que las leyes lo exijan, menos los importes vencidos y pendientes de pago de su cuenta, incluidos, entre otros, los importes adeudados por equipos no devueltos o dañados.\\n\\n(f) Preguntas sobre la facturación.

ACCIONES DE ARBITRAJE O RECLAMACIONES DE MENOR CUANTÍA.**\\n\\nConfiamos en que estará satisfecho con nuestros servicios, pero si existe algún problema que precisa ser resuelto, en esta sección se explican las expectativas mutuas al respecto. USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDAN RESOLVER DISPUTAS SOLO POR ARBITRAJE O EN UN TRIBUNAL DE DEMANDAS DE MENOR CUANTÍA. EL ARBITRAJE NO INCLUYE LA PARTICIPACIÓN DE UN JUEZ O UN JURADO, Y LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS PUEDEN DIFERIR, PERO UN ÁRBITRO PUEDE CONCEDER LOS MISMOS DAÑOS Y EL MISMO RESARCIMIENTO Y DEBE ACEPTAR LOS MISMOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTE ACUERDO COMO LO HARÍA UN TRIBUNAL. SI LA LEY PERMITE LA CONCESIÓN DE HONORARIOS DE ABOGADO, UN ÁRBITRO TAMBIÉN PUEDE DECRETARLOS. ASIMISMO, AMBAS PARTES ACORDAMOS QUE:\\n\\n(a) La Ley Federal De Arbitraje se aplica a este Acuerdo. Excepto los casos que califiquen para su presentación en un tribunal competente para demandas de menor cuantía, toda disputa que surja en relación con el presente Acuerdo o con los equipos, productos y servicios que le prestemos (o de cualquier publicidad de cualquier producto o servicio) será resuelta por uno o más árbitros imparciales ante la American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Asimismo, usted puede presentar en el Better Business Bureau (“BBB”), a consideración de las agencias gubernamentales federales, estatales o locales, cualquier asunto que usted pueda tener y estas agencias pueden, si la ley lo permite, reclamarnos el resarcimiento en su nombre.\\n\\n(b) A MENOS QUE USTED Y VERIZON ACUERDEN LO CONTRARIO, EL ARBITRAJE TENDRÁ LUGAR EN EL CONDADO DE LA JURISDICCIÓN DEL SERVICIO. Para reclamaciones mayores a $10,000, se aplicarán las normas de arbitraje de la AAA; en tales casos, el perdedor puede apelar a un órgano colegiado de tres nuevos árbitros para que revise la decisión. En reclamaciones de $10,000 o de inferior cuantía, la parte demandante puede elegir las normas de la AAA, o bien puede entablar una demanda individual en un tribunal competente para demandas de menor cuantía. Usted puede solicitar información sobre procedimientos, normas y cargos a la AAA (www.adr.org) o a nosotros. En reclamaciones de $10,000 o de menos cuantía, usted puede elegir si desea que el arbitraje se realice solo en base a documentos enviados al árbitro, o mediante una audiencia en persona o por teléfono.\\n\\n(c) ESTE ACUERDO NO PERMITE ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS, INCLUSO SI SON PERMITIDOS POR LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS O REGLAS DE LA AAA. INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER OTRA DISPOSICIÓN DE ESTE ACUERDO, EL ÁRBITRO NO TENDRÁ AUTORIDAD PARA DETERMINAR SI ES PERMISIBLE EL ARBITRAJE COLECTIVO. EL ÁRBITRO TAMPOCO TENDRÁ AUTORIDAD PARA PRESIDIR ARBITRAJES COLECTIVOS NI PARA OTORGAR NINGÚN TIPO DE RECURSO COLECTIVO. EN CAMBIO, EL ÁRBITRO PUEDE DECRETAR UN RESARCIMIENTO MONETARIO O CONMINATORIO SOLO EN FAVOR DE LA PARTE INDIVIDUAL QUE RECLAME EL RESARCIMIENTO Y SOLO EN LA MEDIDA NECESARIA PARA OFRECER EL RESARCIMIENTO GARANTIZADO POR LA RECLAMACIÓN INDIVIDUAL DE DICHA PARTE. NO PODRÁN APLICARSE TEORÍAS DE RESPONSABILIDAD NI SOLICITUDES DE COMPENSACIÓN COLECTIVAS O REPRESENTATIVAS O CON UN APODERADO GENERAL EN NINGÚN ARBITRAJE REALIZADO CONFORME A ESTE ACUERDO.

Rate Plans **\\n\\n**One-Year Term Plan **\\n\\n**A. Description **\\n\\nVerizon Infospeed DSL Solutions One-Year Term Plan provides Verizon Customers discounted rates based on commitments of a specific term. The One-Year Term Plan encompasses all of Customer\\'s Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements.\\n\\nIf Customer is not the end user of the Service, then Customer who purchases Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under the One-Year Term Plan assumes the following obligations:\\n\\nCustomer will submit orders to Company electronically in a format and manner designated by Company;\\n\\nCustomer will provision all Customer premises equipment to its end users;\\n\\nCustomer will deal directly with its end users and will be solely liable with respect to all matters relating to the Service, including marketing, ordering, installation, maintenance, repair, billing and collections; and\\n\\nCustomer will not direct its end users to contact Company regarding any aspect of the Service.\\n\\nTwo rate schedules are available for the One-Year Term Plan:\\n\\nSchedule I is available to Customers that subscribe to the One-Year Term Plan on or before August 31, 2001.\\n\\nSchedule II is available to Customers that subscribe to the One-Year Term Plan on or after September 1, 2001.\\n\\nAt expiration of the One-Year Term Plan, Customer may choose to convert to the month-to-month rates, or continue with rates, charges, terms and conditions in effect at the end of the expiring Term Plan on a year-to-year basis. A conversion to month-to-month rates, or discontinuance, will require that Customer submit a service change order.\\n\\nOne-Year Term Plans are subject to payments for early termination.\\n\\n**B. Termination without Liability **\\n\\nCustomer may terminate a term plan without termination liability should the monthly rates increase during the term of the existing term plan. Subsequent to a rate increase, Customer must either elect to terminate the term plan without liability or continue the term plan at the new rate.\\n\\nEnd users subscribing to Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement(s) under a one-year term who change to an ISP/Content Provider subscribing to Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under a Five-Year Term and Volume Discount.\\n\\nPlan are automatically included in the ISP/Content Provider\\'s Five-Year TVDP. No termination liability applies to the terminated one-year term plan of the end user.\\n\\n**C. Termination Liability **\\n\\nIf Customer elects to discontinue its term plan prior to the end of the commitment period, termination liability charges will apply. Liability will be the difference between what would have been charged had Customer had the month- to-month rate for each Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement in-service at the end of each month Customer subscribed to the term plan less all payments made and owed.\\n\\nFive-Year Term and Volume Discount Plan (TVDP)\\n\\n**A. Description **\\n\\nVerizon Infospeed DSL Solutions Five-Year Term and Volume Discount Plan (5N-TVDP) provides Customers discounted rates for Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions based on commitments of a specific term with minimum volumes. Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions is subject to the terms and conditions set forth above.\\n\\nA Customer who purchases Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions under the 5N-TVDP assumes the following obligations:\\n\\nCustomer will submit orders to Company electronically in a format and manner designated by Company;\\n\\nCustomer will provision all Customer premises equipment to its end users;\\n\\nCustomer will deal directly with its end users and will be solely liable with respect to all matters relating to the Service, including marketing, ordering, installation, maintenance, repair, billing and collections; and\\n\\nCustomer will not direct its end users to contact Company regarding any aspect of the Service.\\n\\nCustomer agrees to be billed via Company\\'s standard billing system for Infospeed DSL.\\n\\nThe 5N-TVDP has three optional volume Commitment Levels, A, B and C. Each Commitment Level has minimum service arrangement volumes assigned for each year of the plan. The Commitment Level includes all of Customer\\'s billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions and Premium DSL arrangements. Commitment Levels are selected by Customer and must be designated in Customer\\'s order for 5N-TVDP. The Commitment Levels are specified following.\\n\\nCustomer with an existing 1-Year Term Plan may migrate all existing Service arrangements to a 5N-TVDP without termination liability.\\n\\nAt the expiration of a 5N-TVDP, Customer may commit to a new 5N-TVDP, convert to month-to-month or One-Year Term Plan rates as specified above, or continue with rates, charges, terms and conditions in effect at the end of the expiring 5N-TVDP on a year-to-year basis. A commitment to a new 5N-TVDP, conversion to month-to-month or One-Year Term Plan rates, or a request to discontinue Service will require that Customer submit a service change order.\\n\\nThe 5N-TVDP is subject to payments for missed annual commitments (\"Shortfall Liability\") and for early termination (\"Termination Liability\").\\n\\n**B. Annual Review **\\n\\nThe Commitment Level is reviewed at the end of each Subscription Year on the service anniversary date. A count is taken of all billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements as of the last day of the Subscription Year. Customers who do not meet the minimum quantity of billed arrangements for their Commitment Level on such date will be so notified.\\n\\nSubscription Year One will begin on the service anniversary date, which is the Subscription Date indicated on the Application For Service agreement signed by the Company and the Customer. Each Subscription Year runs 12 months from its service anniversary date.\\n\\nIf, at the annual review, the total quantity of billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements that Customer has on the last day of the Subscription Year does not meet the respective minimum Annual Commitment Level, a Shortfall Liability will be assessed. In addition, Customers with Commitment Levels B and C with less than the minimum arrangement volumes will be reassigned to a reduced Commitment Level for the next year based on their current arrangement volume (e.g., a 5N-TVDP Customer in Commitment Level C with 125,000 arrangements billed at the end of year three would be placed in Commitment Level B for year four).\\n\\nAt the end of any Subscription Year, Customer may elect to move to a higher Commitment Level for the next Subscription Year and for the remainder of the 5N-TVDP, if it has met the minimum arrangement volume for its existing Commitment Level. However, should Customer fail to meet the minimum arrangement volume for the higher Commitment Level by the end of the Subscription Year following such election, an additional charge will be assessed equal to 10% of the Shortfall Liability for the Subscription Year, as specified below.\\n\\n**C. Shortfall Liability **\\n\\nShortfall liability applies to any 5N-TVDP Customer that fails to meet the minimum arrangement volumes for its designated commitment level.\\n\\nShortfall liability is based on the difference between the monthly rate for the designated commitment level and the monthly rate for the commitment level that should have been charged based upon the actual quantity of billed Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements at the end of the Subscription Year. The shortfall liability is equal to the difference in the monthly rate multiplied by the sum of all arrangements billed at the end of each month during such Subscription Year. For example, at the end of Subscription Year Two, a 5N-TVDP Customer with Commitment Level C and only 10,000 arrangements in-service will be assessed the difference in the monthly rate between Commitment Level B and Commitment Level C for each arrangement billed at the end of each month during the Subscription Year.\\n\\nCustomer may stay in its commitment level by paying an alternative shortfall liability equal to the minimum arrangement volume applicable to its Commitment Level less the actual number of Verizon Infospeed DSL arrangements billed at the end of the Subscription Year multiplied by the current monthly rate for the selected commitment level, multiplied by six.\\n\\nAn additional payment of 10% of the shortfall liability is assessed those Customers who fail to meet the minimum arrangement volume after moving to a higher commitment level the previous year.\\n\\nCustomers who fall below the minimum arrangement volume for Commitment Level A in any Subscription Year will be terminated from the 5N-TVDP and will be subject to termination liability. All of Customer\\'s Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangements will revert to the basic month-to-month rates.\\n\\nIf a Customer falls below the minimum volume for Commitment Level A and is terminated from the 5N-TVDP twice, in consecutive Subscription Years, the Customer may not subscribe to any term plan for 12 months after being moved to month-to-month rates.\\n\\n**D. Termination Without Liability **\\n\\nCustomer may terminate a 5N-TVDP without termination liability or shortfall liability should the monthly rates increase during the term of the existing 5N-TVDP, exclusive of any increase due to local, state or federal fees, taxes or surcharges. Subsequent to a rate increase, Customer must either elect to terminate the plan without liability or continue the 5N-TVDP at the new rate. Customer\\'s continuation in the 5N-TVDP 30 days or more following a rate increase shall constitute Customer\\'s election to continue the plan at the new rate.\\n\\n**E. Termination Liability **\\n\\nIf Customer elects to discontinue its 5N-TVDP prior to the end of the commitment period, termination liability charges will apply. Liability will be the difference between what would have been charged had Customer had the month-to-month rate set forth in Section V.A, below for each Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement billed at the end of each month Customer subscribed to the 5N-TVDP less all payments made and owed, including any shortfall liability payments made and owed.\\n\\n**V.

Consequently, for purposes of this Service, the term \"customer\" is defined as a telecommunications carrier that resells voice services pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(4).\\n\\nEffective August 15, 2006, DRL service is no longer available to new Customers. However, Customers with existing accounts in a particular state or area can continue to purchase DRL service for those states or areas in which they have an existing DRL account.\\n\\n**I. Service Description **\\n\\n**A.** Verizon DSL Over Resold Lines (DRL) is a data access service. It uses DSL technology to transport data over available compatible facilities that are concurrently used to provide resold voice services to the same end user premises. Data traffic generated by a customer-provided modem is transported to the Verizon DRL Connection Point. From there, the traffic is transported to the end user\\'s Information Service Provider (ISP) or content provider via other Company services.\\n\\n**B. **The following types of Verizon DRL are available based on the upstream and downstream speed combinations chosen by the customer.\\n\\n**1. **Verizon DRL 768K/128K provides maximum speeds of 768 Kilobits per second (Kbps) downstream and 128 Kbps upstream.\\n\\n**2. **Verizon DRL 1.5M/128K provides maximum speeds of 1.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) downstream and 128 Kbps upstream.\\n\\n**3. **Verizon DRL 1.5M/384K provides maximum speeds of 1.5 Mbps downstream and 384 Kbps upstream.\\n\\n**4.** Verizon DRL 7.1M/768K provides maximum speeds of 7.1 Mbps downstream and 768 Kbps upstream.\\n\\n**5. **Verizon DRL 384K/384K provides maximum speeds of 384 Kbps downstream and 384 Kbps upstream.\\n\\n**6. **Verizon DRL 768K/768K provides maximum speeds of 768 Kbps downstream and 768 Kbps upstream.\\n\\n**7. **Verizon DRL 3M/768K provides maximum speeds of 3 Mbps downstream and 768 Kbps upstream.\\n\\nThe data speeds listed above are maximum speeds. Actual speeds may be lower due to the impact of loop distance, modem technology and other factors. Therefore, performance levels cannot be guaranteed. This includes data speeds, throughput, and packet loss.\\n\\n**C. **Optional Features\\n\\n**1. **Direct PVC Premium Service\\n\\nDirect PVC Premium Service allows the customer to provide its end-user with a static Internet Protocol (IP) address on a Verizon Infospeed DSL Solutions arrangement by using a Direct Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) architecture.\\n\\nDirect PVC Premium Service will be provided subject to the availability and limitations of Company facilities.\\n\\n**a. **In the following states, the existing network architecture supports the capability to assign static IP addresses.

Capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement unless otherwise defined in this Attachment 3. **\\n\\n**Effective December 1, 2008, Verizon Infospeed Premium DSL Service is no longer available to Customers. However, Verizon will continue to support such existing Customer Premium DSL accounts after November 30, 2008 under the following terms and conditions. **\\n\\n**I. Service Description **\\n\\nPremium DSL is a high-speed symmetrical (upstream and downstream data rates are equal) data-only access service. Premium DSL also features static IP Addressing, Variable Bit Rate Non-Real Time Quality of Service and support for multiple users. The service uses DSL technology to transport data over compatible facilities to an end user premises. Data traffic generated by a customer-provided modem is transported to the Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point. From there, the traffic is transported to the end user\\'s Information Service Provider (ISP) or content provider via other Telephone Company services.\\n\\n**A. **Static IP Addressing - The Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to a computer never changes. The static IP address becomes the permanent address of the computer on the internet, making it possible for other Internet users to locate and connect to the computer.\\n\\n**B. **Variable Bit Rate Non-Real Time Quality of Service - Provides customers with traffic prioritization throughout the ATM network. For example, during times of congestion on the network, the data of Premium DSL customers will have a significantly higher bandwidth prioritization (i.e., low cell loss) over the data of other non-Premium DSL customers.\\n\\nFive service level tiers of Premium DSL are available:\\n\\n(1) 192/192 Kbps\\n\\n(2) 384/384 Kbps\\n\\n(3) 768/768 Kbps\\n\\n(4) 1.1/1.1 Mbps\\n\\n(5) 1.5/1.5 Mbps\\n\\nThe data speeds listed above are maximum speeds. Actual speeds may be lower due to the impact of loop distance, modem technology and other factors.\\n\\n**II. Terms and Conditions **\\n\\n**A. **The minimum service period for Premium DSL is one year. In the event Premium DSL is disconnected in less than one year, a minimum service period charge, as described below, will be assessed.\\n\\n**B. **Premium DSL is provided subject to the availability and limitations of Telephone Company facilities and related equipment.\\n\\n**C. **The Company will provision and maintain Premium DSL from the Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point to the network interface device (NID) at the designated end user premises. The Company will advise the customer of any additional equipment necessary to support Premium DSL. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary additional equipment, such as a compatible DSL modem.\\n\\n**D. **Access from Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point may be provided via Telephone Company data network interface services such as Frame Relay Service, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Service and dedicated Special Access services. The regulations, rates and charges for the specific type of service apply as specified in other Telephone Company tariff(s) from which the service is ordered and are in addition to rates and charges for Premium DSL.\\n\\n**E.** The customer will provide the Company with the necessary information (e.g., name and address/location, telephone number, serving area, etc., related to end user and ISP/Content Provider) to provision Premium DSL.\\n\\n**F. **The Company will obtain qualification information on facilities to determine suitability of such facilities for Premium DSL. The Company will not provide Premium DSL on facilities that are unsuitable for the Service, nor will the Company provide Premium DSL if it determines that such provision will produce interference to other services.\\n\\n**G. **The Company reserves the right to temporarily interrupt Premium DSL for maintenance, software upgrade and in emergency situations. The customer will obtain authorization from the end user to allow the Company employees or its authorized agents to enter end user\\'s designated premises at any reasonable hour for the purpose of installing, inspecting or repairing the Premium DSL arrangement. The customer will also obtain permission from the end user, upon termination of Premium DSL, to allow Company employees or its authorized agents to enter the premises at a reasonable hour to remove any Company equipment. The customer will present evidence of such authorizations to the Company upon request. The Company may terminate an end user\\'s Premium DSL in the event such authorizations are not obtained and maintained.\\n\\n**H. **Scheduled maintenance activities that adversely affect Service will be conducted during pre-determined maintenance windows at time intervals that have the least likelihood of interruption to Service during peak usage periods.\\n\\n**III. Rate Regulations **\\n\\n**A**. Monthly Rate - A monthly recurring charge applies for each Premium DSL arrangement.\\n\\n**B.** DSL Installation Charge - A nonrecurring DSL Installation Charge applies for the installation/acquisition of loop facilities from the Premium DSL Connection Point to the end user\\'s premises.\\n\\n**C. **Service Activation - A nonrecurring charge applies for the initial service activation associated with each Premium DSL arrangement.\\n\\n**D. **ISP/Content Provider Charge - A nonrecurring charge applies for activities associated with a change in ISP/Content Provider for each Premium DSL arrangement changed.\\n\\n**E.** Speed Change/Downward - A nonrecurring charge applies for activities associated with a downward change in speed from one service type to another with each Premium DSL arrangement changed.\\n\\n**F.** Speed Change/Upward - No nonrecurring charge applies for activities associated with an upward change in speed from one service type to another with each Premium DSL arrangement changed.\\n\\n**G.** Software Change - A nonrecurring charge applies for a software change associated with the remapping of circuit information or other software changes associated with a Premium DSL arrangement. This charge is applied on a per software change basis. This charge also applies when the customer\\'s Premium DSL service is validly assigned, or when the customer\\'s Premium DSL service is suspended and transitioned to a new provider due to nonpayment. In this case, the software change charge applies to the new provider on a per software change basis.\\n\\n**IV. Minimum Service Period Charge **\\n\\n**A. **The customer may disconnect Premium DSL without a minimum service period charge should the monthly rate increase during the term of the existing one year commitment, exclusive of any increase due to local, state or federal fees, taxes or surcharges. The Telephone Company will notify the customer in advance of any upcoming rate increase in order to allow sufficient time for the customer to determine if it wishes to disconnect Premium DSL.\\n\\n**B. **Upon notification by the Telephone Company of an upcoming rate increase, the customer must either elect to disconnect the service without liability or continue the service at the new rate. The customer\\'s continuation of Premium DSL 30 days or more following a rate increase shall constitute the customer\\'s election to continue at the new rate.\\n\\n**C. **If a customer elects to discontinue Premium DSL prior to the end of the one year minimum service period without the occurrence of a Premium DSL rate increase, a minimum service period charge will apply. The minimum service period charge is equal to the lesser of $250.00, or the monthly rate for the customer\\'s Service, as set forth herein, times the number of months remaining in the initial one year minimum service period.\\n\\n**V.

Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives.

Asset  rationalization  recorded  during  the  second  quarter  of  2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  primarily  relates  to  Verizon  Business  network  assets  that  we  made  a  decision  to  cease  use  of  as  part  of  our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon\\'s annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain  administrative  fees.  Business  transformation  costs  recorded  during  2023  primarily  relate  to  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  strategic  partnership initiatives  in  our  managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers.

Further,  the exclusion of  non-operational  items  and special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is  calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon Business  Group (\"Verizon Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation costs  and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued transformation initiatives. Asset  rationalization recorded during the second quarter  of  2023 relates to certain real  estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of  as  part  of  our  transformation initiatives. Asset  rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter  of  2023 primarily  relates  to Verizon Business  network  assets  that  we made a decision to cease use of  as  part  of  our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon\\'s annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business  transformation costs  recorded during 2023 primarily  relate to costs  incurred in connection with strategic  partnership initiatives  in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of  our BlueJeans business offering in 2023.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated operating revenues.  \\nWe have not  provided a reconciliation for  our  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast  because we cannot,  without  unreasonable effort,  predict  the special items that could arise during 2025.'},\n",

Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

       "        'content': \"Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by addressing the evolving policy and macroeconomic landscape. We continue to monitor the ongoing developments, and we're confident in our ability to effectively manage our business for our customers and shareholders.  \\nIn periods of heightened uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength, given the importance and the essential nature of our connectivity services, the size and quality of our customer base, and the strength of our balance sheet.  \\nOur diverse portfolio of offerings serves all market segments and positions us for success in any economic environment. And with our bias for action and position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment but thrive in it.  \\nNow let me turn to our results. We had an exceptional financial start of the year delivering strong growth across our key financial metrics. Wireless service revenue was up 2.7% at the high end of our guided range. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion was our highest reported result ever, growing 4% and exceeding our guided range.  \\nFree cash flow was up over $900 million and enabled continued execution of our capital allocation priorities. Even with the recent declines in consumer confidence, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance.  \\nOur comprehensive portfolio of offerings and strategic moves we have made over the last year position as well for sustainable financial and subscriber growth while also improving the customer experience.  \\nThese moves include our brand refresh along with continuous evolution of customer first offerings such as myPlan, myHome, and My Biz Plan, organic and inorganic broadband expansion with the pending acquisition of Frontier, AI Connect and satellite partnerships that enables texting anywhere for free.  \\nRootMetrics recently recognized Verizon as the best, fastest and most reliable 5G network in the US, and our network continues to get even better. On mobility, we're on track to deploy C-band to 80% to 90% of our planned sites by year end, and we are aggressively rolling out 5G advanced features.  \\nOn Fios expansion, we're ahead of our plan year-to-date to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year. On fixed wireless access, our multi-dwelling unit solution is expected to gradually ramp over time along with continued expansion of homes and businesses covered with ongoing C-band deployment.  \\nTurning to our operation performance, our segmentation strategy focused on delivering targeted offerings is yielding positive results. We delivered a year-on-year improvement in combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds. We did have a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn due to recent price ups and pressure from federal government accounts.  \\nHowever, our prepaid nets adds of 137,000 were the best since the TracFone acquisition. In broadband, we continue to take share. With fixed wireless access and fiber, we have the most complete offering covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over the time.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

       "        'content': \"Our fixed wireless access product continues to lead our broadband growth, and we have great momentum to reach our next milestone of 8 million to 9 million fixed wireless access subscribers by 2028. We're excited to expand our broadband opportunity and continue to scale our mobile and home offerings as we work towards closing the Frontier transaction.  \\nThe consumer group's multi-year business transformation effort is progressing as planned, and you'll hear more about that from Sampath shortly. In the business group, our private networks business continued to scale. We closed more than a dozen deals in the quarter, including private networks for AdventHealth and Nucor.  \\nWe were named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for managed IoT connectivity services worldwide and reached an agreement to deliver a turnkey IoT solution for Atlanta Hawks. We have seen accelerated interest in AI Connect and continue to expand our partner ecosystem.  \\nLooking ahead, our priorities are clear: a continued focus on growing wireless service revenue, expanding adjusted EBITDA and generating strong free cash flow, accelerating our mobility and broadband growth and scale private networks, leverage our existing fiber and edge compute assets to unlock new revenue stream through our AI connect offerings, focus on financial discipline, operational excellence and customer experience, and finally, execute on our capital allocation priorities, invest in the business, support and grow our dividends, pay down debt and eventually share repurchases.  \\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tony.\"},\n",

We're taking share on broadband, and we continue to innovate with myPlan, myHome and our new My Biz Plan to deliver best-in-class value across all of our customers.  \\nOur consumer postpaid phone net losses of [356,000] reflect the impact of recent pricing actions. We exited the first quarter with positive momentum. Consumer Postpaid phone gross ads in March were up mid single-digits from the prior year, and the performance in April continues to be strong.  \\nAdditionally, our new three-year price lock and free phone guarantee is resonating in the market. We remain confident in our ability to deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds year over year for the full year. Business phone net adds were 67,000 in the period, impacted by pressure within federal government accounts.  \\nWe continue to work with customers of all sizes to deliver connectivity solutions that match their needs. Our momentum continued to build in core prepaid where we delivered 137,000 net adds. Our strong execution and investment in Visible, Total Wireless and Straight Talk is paying off, and we continue to expect positive service revenue contribution from core prepaid in the second half of the year.  \\nIn broadband, our Fios and fixed wireless access offerings are attracting new customers quarter after quarter. We had 339,000 net adds in the period and we continue to take market share. This is a solid start to the year and one we expect to build on as we expand our C-band and Fios availability.  \\nShifting to financials. We delivered strong results with 2.7% wireless service revenue growth. This reflects the benefits of pricing actions, expansion of fixed wireless access subscribers and continued adoption of perks and premium plans.  \\nAdjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion grew 4% in the quarter, which represents our best quarter of year-over-year growth in nearly four years and demonstrates our sustained and disciplined approach to growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.19 for the quarter, up 3.5% year over year. Finally, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion positions us to continue to pay down debt in alignment with our capital allocation priorities and ahead of the anticipated close of the Frontier transaction.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

It all starts with how we compete and go to market. Our network is the foundation of everything we offer. We have the best and most reliable network, and we continue to extend our network leadership with our ongoing C-band deployment and broadband expansion with fixed wireless access and fiber, including the pending acquisition of Frontier.  \\nOur customer-first connectivity offerings deliver unmatched control, value and simplicity for all our customer segments. Over the last two years, we have introduced targeted offers for all customer segments across mobility and broadband. As the market leader, we remain committed to introducing new and innovative offerings that meet the evolving needs of our customers.  \\nNext is the value-added services, which is one of our key differentiators in the market. We offer add-on perks including exclusive discounts on some of the top streaming services such as Netflix and Max. Given the size and the quality of our base and the scale of our distribution network, we offer rates that customers cannot find anywhere else, and we will continue to expand our perk portfolio.  \\nOver the past few years, we have dedicated substantial resources and capital to enhance our customer experience through various initiatives including AI for customer care and personalization. Although the industry, including Verizon still has room to improve, we have made great progress towards our goal of seamless customer interactions.  \\nLastly, our brand is a pivotal element in our go-to-market strategy. Recognizing its importance, we made a strategic decision to refresh our brand last year, and we are committed to further developing and strengthening our brand to drive continued growth and customer engagement.  \\nBy focusing on these key pillars of our value proposition, we attract new customers, foster loyalty among existing ones and maximize the long-term value of each customer relationship. This holistic approach ensures that we remain competitive in the marketplace and drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth.  \\nNow, let me turn to Sampath, who will provide more details on our consumer transformation journey.\"},\n",

When I stepped into the role of Consumer Unit CEO, just over two years ago, Hans and I immediately set a course for a multi-year transformation that offers what customers need in today's increasingly dynamic economic environment. We committed to delivering real value to our customers while driving sustained long-term growth.  \\nLet me walk you through our transformation journey and the results so far. Beginning in 2023, we revamped our sales engine, moving to a regional model, individual sales incentives and a stronger focus on local marketing. We also launched myPlan, giving customers more control, value and simplicity.  \\nThis allowed us to significantly reduce our perceived price premium while driving higher average revenue per user through perks, insurance and financial services. In 2024, we relaunched our brand and accelerated myPlan and myHome adoption. We solidified the Verizon model of convergence with the announcement of the Frontier transaction and ramping up our current in footprint fiber builds.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

       "        'content': \"This transaction will help enable our long-term goal of offering broadband to over 100 million premises, including fiber passings of 35 million to 40 million. We also turned around our prepaid business, which includes the industry's largest portfolio of brands. This was driven by a revamp of our value propositions, expanded exclusive and third-party distribution, and instilling the same operational rigor we introduced in our postpaid business.  \\nThe core prepaid brands returned to subscriber growth in 2024 and achieved their best results since the TracFone acquisition this quarter. This demonstrates our ability to win across all market segments. Customers are responding to our offers and we anticipate gaining market share in prepaid this year.  \\nAs we enter year three, we are doubling down on our customer-first strategy with an increased focus on customer retention with the Verizon value guarantee, and industry leading 3-year price lock, free phone guarantee for everyone and savings you cannot get elsewhere.  \\nBefore  I  dive  into  the  Verizon  value  guarantee,  let  us  quickly  recap  what  makes  our  offering  stand  out  from  the  competition.  Our  strategic differentiation centers on creating real customer value through a unique combination of network superiority and customer first offerings. Our myPlan and myHome offerings have been the key drivers of our transformation.  \\nThese offerings go beyond basic connectivity to include premium entertainment and adjacent services that deliver significant savings for the customer. Today, you can get8 of the most popular streaming services from Verizon for $50. That is value customers can only get at Verizon.  \\nOur portfolio of adjacent services include industry leading insurance products for both mobility and the connected home and give customers even more peace of mind. We offer even more ways to save through our financial service partners and products, including the Verizon Visa card and the Openbank high yield savings account with Santander, both exclusive to Verizon customers. This business is growing at a double-digit rate and bringing in margin rich service revenue.  \\nFinally, we launched Verizon Access loyalty program, giving customers access to events like the exclusive pre-sale of 100,000 Beyonce concert tickets, NFL, NBA and NHL games, and lifetime experiences such as the 140,000 free tickets we gave out to the first Verizon Super Bowl fanfest parties.  \\nThere is no other plan in the industry like myPlan in myHome, and the beauty of having them built side by side is our ability to offer seamless account linkage and promote joint offers. For converged customers, our retention rates are significantly better than those with just mobility or broadband validating our convergence strategy.  \\nSimply put, we offer the most differentiated value proposition in the industry and with our recently launched offers for both new and existing customers, we are delivering what people want and need on their terms.  \\nSo now let's turn to what we announced a few weeks ago. We launched a game-changing offer, a 3-year price lock and a free phone guarantee with trade in for new and existing customers. This offer was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and is a key component of our strategy to deliver sustainable growth.  \\nThe premise of this offer began several quarters ago as emerging consumer trends showed a growing desire for predictability, price control and value. All things that are particularly relevant in today's economic environment. Customers want peace of mind, and we are giving them just that.  \\nThe key elements of this offer include a 3-year price lock guarantee that covers the network portion of all tiers of myPlan and myHome, and current customers were automatically enrolled on day one. Guaranteed trade in credit for phones to new and existing customers within their plan tiers, free satellite text messaging on all plans. Customers should not have to pay for texting, and it's part of the value we provide to our customers.  \\nCustomers love our perks and the massive savings they deliver. We had over 10 million perk subscriptions at the end of the first quarter. We now anticipate 15 million subscriptions on our platform by the end of this year, an increase of 1 million perks from our prior forecast in the year-end 2025.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \\nThey love getting more value for their money with Verizon Visa card and Openbank high-yield savings account. And customers with both mobile and home services get a free monthly perk that will drive customer loyalty. We did not just launch an offer, we set a new standard for customer value, and customers are responding very well.  \\nEarly indicators in April suggest strong gross add momentum and very good reception from customers, including many new customers attracted to Verizon. We expect the Verizon value guarantee to provide many benefits to Verizon.  \\nFirst, growth. We will continue to drive revenue through higher volumes, higher premium mix, perk adoption and upgrading customers to myPlan. All of that is in addition to revenue benefits from a growing FWA base along with the wholesale business and the momentum with prepaid, which we expect to turn service revenue positive in the second half of the year.  \\nSecond, better customer retention. In the past, we've made necessary price adjustments, which impacted churn, but we expect trends to improve through the year, and this launch puts us on a path to get back to the lowest churn in the industry over time.  \\nAnd third, we have constructed this offer in a flexible manner to give us continued financial discipline. The price lock applies to myPlan and myHome network plans only. It doesn't apply to perks, discounts, taxes or fees, and we can still adjust price on legacy plans or introduce new plans if we see an opportunity in the market. Another important note is that the free phone offer will be tiered by plan and require a device trade-in.  \\nOverall, we believe this is just the beginning of how we'll earn lasting customer loyalty and continue to grow the Verizon base, including deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds in 2025 compared to 2024. We are back to leading the market, not reacting to it, and we are the only carrier with the brand portfolio covering every price point, positioning us for further growth across every segment of the market.  \\nThe 3-year price lock guarantee is the next phase in our consumer transformation, giving consumers the best network, value and 24/7 support with myPlan and myHome, plus additional peace of mind with the free phone and satellite texting. We want to be people's first choice, providing products, services and experience they can't get elsewhere.  \\nWith that, let me turn back to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you, Sampath. In summary, we are on plan with our multi-year consumer transformation. We're offering the most differentiated value proposition, and we are well positioned to drive subscriber and financial growth.  \\nI'm incredibly proud of the team's dedication and efforts transforming the business. I'm confident that the actions we are taking will set the business up for sustainable long-term growth and extend our industry leadership.  \\nNow, Brady, we are ready for questions.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Hans.

Any additional color you can give us on how tariffs on, I guess, first handsets and then telecom equipment could affect the business?  \\nOn the handset side, you expect the promotions to scale with tariffs and what do you expect the impact to be on upgrades? And then on the equipment side, is tariffs on equipment coming into the US mean the budget stays the same and maybe you do less homes passed? Or just how that unfolds?  \\nAnd then secondly, for Sampath, thanks for all the color on the consumers and the strategy. And thanks for the color on the gross adds leaving the quarter. Can we talk a little bit about churn? I mean, is all the new plans and promotions and offers you have in place, does that help churn in the second quarter? Or do we have to wait until the second half of the year?  \\nAnd that comment on getting back to industry-leading churn, is that something you expect to achieve by the fourth quarter, by the end of this year, or just more color on how that plays out would be great?

       "        'content': \"Thank you, John. Let me talk about the tariffs. Of course, tariffs is a little bit of a moving target where they are. But if we take our capital expenditures, it's a very small portion of the [$18 billion], which is the midpoint of the guide this year that it is exposed to tariffs. And on top of that, we are working with all our suppliers, as we have done so.  \\nI mean, during COVID-19, we had no impact at all with the supply chain issues there were because I think my team is the best in the industry to handle that. So that will not change any type of investments we're doing in CapEx or anything. We cannot foresee that.  \\nWhen it comes to handsets, that's also, of course, very early to say where the tariff is going to go and what's going to happen. But in general, if the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we are not planning to cover that in our work.  \\nThat's just not going to be possible. So we will continue to be with financial discipline in whatever promotions we have, but we will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handset. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market. But again, it's too early to say. We don't know where tariff is going to go.  \\nBut I think my team is well prepared for handling all of it. And on the consumer side, I think Sampath has talked quite a lot about it. I think that the team has done a tremendous work with doing all the new proposals and the new promotions we had all the way from myPlan and myHome home and all of that.  \\nAnd now we come to the third leg with the price lock and the phone guarantee. I think we're right in the moment, and we're leading from a very strong financial position. But I'll let Sampath talk a little bit more about the churn and where we are there.\"},\n",

It helped us lock our revenue for the rest of the year and it was the right thing to do. Look, in Q1, the cohorts that were priced up had higher elasticity than anticipated. And the higher churn can be largely attributed and isolated to those cohorts.  \\nSo because of that, we think churn is transitory, it is abating, and we expect to get back to BAU by the second half of the year. And we've got other levers that we are deploying quite aggressively. The first and the biggest one is Verizon value guarantee. The 3-year price lock and the free phone base is resonating really well, both for our base and for new customers as well.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

We have done -- that's why I'm not sure how many quarters right now as well as now we turned around the prepaid business as well, which I'm very proud of what the team has done.

I would ask Sampath to comment on the momentum that we have gained in March and April.

If you think about the mix of business shifting more wireless now, Kyle and the team have been growing both mobility and FWA for many quarters now.  \\nSo that mix shift is skewing more wireless.

So we haven't seen that.  \\nAnd Tony can talk a little about the payments as well, but they are continue very intact, no deterioration on payments. And then there have been speculation also of any growth in handsets due to worries for tariffs. I think what we can see, and I think Sampath can talk about it is that we have seen a somewhat uptick.  \\nBut I think it comes more from our offering that we start with a new 3-year price lock-in as well as that we had any phone guarantee trade-in. I think that has driven a little bit more handsets for us, not per se. But maybe Sampath and Tony will talk a little bit, and Tony will talk about the margin as well. So let's start with Sampath about the momentum there.  \\nSowmyanarayan Sampath - Verizon Communications Inc - Executive Vice President and CEO of Verizon Consumer Group  \\nLook, we have good momentum in our business that March and April were very strong, and April have double-digit growth there. We're seeing good premium mix, in other words, a portion of our base new customers that is taking our premium plans. That mix has actually grown higher.  \\nSo that suggests that a value prop is resonating well and customers like what we offer. In terms of upgrades, look, Q1 was a bit soft, and we didn't chase volumes where there was no demand, we didn't think it made sense for us to chase volumes there.  \\nFor the whole year, I think we're still committing to a mid single-digit growth in overall upgrade. There will be some volatility quarter-to-quarter as that works through. As we come into April, there will be some pent-up demand mostly from the Verizon value guarantee. Customers really like that. So they're going to take advantage of that. But overall, for the year, we still think mid single-digit growth for upgrade holds. Tony?\"},\n",

So as you're looking to still target better consumer phone net adds in '25 over '24, can you give us an update on how you're seeing postpaid phone industry growth and the volumes you're expecting for the year, and how important that is relative to your target for your own volume?  \\nAnd then within that, are you seeing any impacts from changes in immigration policy? And do you have a better sense of how to frame the potential sensitivities to the forward operating prospects?  \\nAnd then just one more, if I could. You mentioned some impact from the federal government on business postpaid phone net adds. I'm just curious if there's additional impacts that you could see as you move through this year, whether it's on the wireless side or on the business wireline side? Thanks.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nLet me start. First of all, I'm going to let Sampath comment on the postpaid market. But I would say, on the immigration, we don't have any impact of that and that's not something that we have seen anything from. When it comes to the federal government, what we comment on in the quarter was wireless, where we had a little bit reduction in wireless as we saw some impact of the new government and their efficiency work.\"},\n",

So what I will talk about more is wireless service revenue and how we think about it in the medium term. As far as the Verizon value guarantee, it was contemplated in our '25 guidance. But let me talk about some of the puts and takes that we have in our wireless revenue.  \\nThe first is higher volumes. We'll have higher volumes in '25 compared to '24, and that will help with wireless service revenue. Second is only 50% of our base is on myPlan with the Verizon value guarantee, there are more incentives for customers to migrate to my plan, which tends to be accreted to revenue immediately.  \\nLonger term, look, we have step-ups. There's a lot of value in our ultimate high-end plan, including an upgrade to unlimited hotspot, which we did last week, and it's really helping with the premium mix. Perks is another area that we'll continue to grow. We had said that we'll get to 14 million perks by the end of this year. I'm happy to say that I think we have line of sight to 15 million perks, an increase of 1 million perks by the time the year ends.  \\nFWA, look, that's a place for good, strong service revenue growth, both on volume, but also on ARPU with a much higher premium mix that we had planned. Value on our prepaid business, historically, has been a drag on our service revenue.  \\nIn 2024, it was a 0.8% drag on our overall service revenue. We expect that to turn positive in the second half as volumes grow nicely, and that will help with the long-term service revenue growth. The last is our wholesale business. It has healthy service revenue growth margin in it. So those are all the different levers that we have at our disposal to drive long-term wireless service revenue growth, and we are very comfortable with sustained growth in our business.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Peter.

Obviously, EBITDA, there is SG&amp;A side in consumer was -- I wouldn't necessarily say depressed, but was there any perhaps savings or a pullback in spend related to SG&amp;A that will resurface or be a bit more aggressive in 2Q and beyond as we think about the price guarantee and getting some, I guess, advertising and sales and marketing push behind that? So that's a quick just housekeeping question.  \\nAnd then as you're thinking about the company's broader multiyear convergence strategy, obviously, there is some fiber available in the market as well as others looking for potential partners. But if you step back, how do you think about perhaps -- or does it make sense to either partner with additional fiber providers to accelerate the fiber-to-the-home or your fiber locations push? Or does it perhaps make sense to accelerate your fiber footprint build engine somewhat at the expense of leverage and free cash flow in the interim ahead of the Frontier deal close?

On the fiber, we're already ramping up right now our fiber deployment, and that's contemplated in our CapEx from [$450 million OFS to $650 million]. That's ongoing. And our focus right now is, of course, to close Frontier.  \\nAnd when we have Frontier closed, we have said initially as we didn't have all the data, that plus 1 million OFS a year should be what we're targeting and plus means plus. We haven't defined in that we need to get closer to the closing to give you an update, and we will do that.  \\nSo we are very focused on that and see that we're doing the right thing. And then on convergence, the only thing I would say, first of all, I think we have owner economics on everything in broadband and mobility, which means that we have a great position on convergence. And a big portion, I would say, the majority and maybe Sampath can comment on it.  \\nIf you take the majority of all the customers coming in on broadband this quarter, they're [mostly] (corrected by company after the call) converged.

And that helps with long-term churn, but also proves the Verizon model of convergence, which tends to be very demand-led, it's based on a strong offering and giving customers what they want, which is flexibility, not just using price and promotions to get a converged offering.\"},\n",

Maybe before we end up, I mean, people usually ask me what questions I will not answer, I think what we haven't gotten any questions on our prepaid business.

       "        'content': \"Brady Connor Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nHello and welcome to discussion of our first quarter 2025 results.  I'm Brady Connor, and on this recording you'll hear from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas.  \\nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found at the start of the earnings presentation posted on our Investor Relations website.  \\nInformation in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website.  \\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  \\nDiscussions and comments related to our 2025 guidance exclude any assumptions regarding the potential effects of the tariff environment, owing to the uncertain and evolving nature of these impacts.  \\nMaterials related to this discussion were posted this morning to our Investor Relations website. Additionally, we hope you'll join the webcast of our discussion of the earnings results and business updates that starts at 8:30am Eastern time today, April 22nd.  \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nWe had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter with continued execution of our longterm strategy. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our business and our strategic advantage as a full-service connectivity provider, driving financial growth despite changing market conditions.  \\nWe delivered strong financial growth across all our key financial metrics in the first quarter.  \\nWireless Service Revenue of 20.8 billion dollars was up 2.7 percent year over year, at the high end of our guided range.  \\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 4% to 12.6 billion dollars. This is our best reported quarterly EBITDA ever, with the highest growth rate in nearly four years.  \\nLastly, we delivered strong free cash flow of 3.6 billion dollars, up over 900 million dollars year-overyear, enabling continued execution of our capital allocation priorities.  \\nOur financial strength is notable considering the dynamic environment, marked by broad macro uncertainties, market volatility, and an evolving global trade landscape. We exited the quarter with positive sales momentum that has continued into April, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance.  \\nWe are actively monitoring the tariff developments and working closely with our strategic suppliers to effectively manage the potential impacts for our customers and shareholders, as we successfully did during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, our diverse portfolio of offerings serves all segments of the market and position us for success in any economic environment.  \\nLet me highlight some of the strategic moves we've made during the last 12 months that improve our ability to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth while improving the customer experience.  \\nAs part of our Consumer transformation, we recently introduced a 3-year price lock and free phone guarantee for new and existing customers on myPlan. We also launched My Biz Plan, which extends the same control, value and simplicity to our small and medium-sized business customers. Our dedication to improving customer experience is reflected in our ongoing development of customerfirst offerings and our brand refresh.  \\nWe accelerated our broadband expansion plans by increasing our organic build pace and through the pending acquisition of Frontier.  \\nAnd we announced our AI Connect offerings to enable AI at scale and open up new revenue streams, and executed on satellite partnerships that enable texting anywhere, for free.  \\nOur network continues to be a key differentiator.  The C-band deployment remains ahead of plan and on track to cover 80 to 90 percent of our planned sites by year end. We are aggressively rolling out 5G Advanced features and making the best 5G network even better. We are also tracking ahead of our FiOS build plans and are on track to deliver 650 thousand incremental passings this year. Our multi-dwelling unit solution for fixed wireless access was recently launched in more than 15 markets, and is expected to gradually ramp up over time. Lastly, we once again earned the top spot in the industry, claiming Best 5G, Fastest 5G, and Most Reliable 5G in the 2024 RootMetrics second half drive tests.  \\nShifting to operational performance, the breadth of our product portfolio, which covers all market segments, delivered year-over-year improvement in our combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds.  We had a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn in Consumer from our recent pricing actions, and pressure from federal government accounts. We continue to execute on our multi-year business transformation effort in Consumer, and remain confident to deliver full-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds. Our prepaid net adds of 137 thousand were the best since the TracFone acquisition and represent a significant year-over-year improvement. Our prepaid brands play a critical role in our segmented-market strategy to ensure we have targeted offerings for all customers.  \\nIn Broadband, we continued to take share and grew our subscriber base with our dual Fixed Wireless Access and fiber strategy, adding 339 thousand subscribers in the quarter. With Fixed Wireless Access and fiber, we have the most complete offering, covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over time. Our Fixed Wireless Access product continues to lead the broadband growth and we have great momentum to reach our next milestone 8 to 9 million Fixed Wireless Access subscribers by 2028. We are excited to expand our broadband opportunity and continue to scale upon closing of our pending Frontier acquisition.  \\nAnd our private networks business continues to scale. We closed more than a dozen deals in the quarter, including private networks for AdventHealth and Nucor.  \\nWe were named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed IoT Connectivity Services worldwide, and reached an agreement to deliver a turnkey IoT solution for Atlanta Hawks.  \\nOn AI Connect, that we presented earlier in the year, we have seen accelerated interest and continue to expand our partner ecosystem. We have added hundreds of new opportunities to our funnel in the first quarter, including some very well-known brands, and seeing particular interest in our dark fiber and wave services.  \\nLooking ahead, we are confident in our strategy to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth.  \\nOur innovative customer-first offerings along with the continuous improvement in our overall mobility performance position us to grow our subscriber base as we progress through the year.  \\nOur growth areas such as broadband, private networks, and AI Connect are scaling rapidly and are unlocking new revenue streams using our existing assets.  \\nFinally, our financial discipline is enabling successful execution of our capital allocation priorities: investing in the business for growth, supporting and growing our dividend, paying down our debt, and eventually executing on share repurchase.  \\nDuring periods of elevated uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience, when our differentiators and structural advantages become even more apparent, helping to protect our business and create durability in our financial performance. And with our bias for action and our position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment, but we will thrive in it.  \\nNow, I'll turn to Tony to discuss our results in greater detail.  \\nAnthony Skiadas Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer  \\nThanks, Hans, and good morning.  \\nThis quarter proved once again that our business is resilient. We provide essential products and remain confident in our full-year guidance.  \\nThe first quarter demonstrated our ability to drive strong financial results.  We delivered Wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of our guided range and our highest quarter of year over year Adjusted EBITDA growth in almost four years.  \\nOur customer segmentation strategy is working. This, together with strong execution, led to an improved combined postpaid and Core prepaid phone net add performance from last year. We achieved this even with challenges in the federal government accounts and churn pressure in Consumer postpaid.  \\nThis pressure caused consumer postpaid phone churn to rise by 7 basis points in the first quarter relative to last year. The increase is largely due to multiple pricing actions that were implemented over the past few months. The collective pricing changes are anticipated to yield over 1 billion dollars in incremental service revenue, allowing for greater operating flexibility for the rest of the year.  \\nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 356 thousand for the first quarter, compared to 194 thousand net losses in the prior year period.  \\nWe exited the first quarter with positive momentum.  Consumer postpaid phone gross adds in March were up mid-single digits from the prior year and the performance in April continues to be strong.  \\nWe're encouraged by the operational trends we're seeing, and are focused on driving mobility volume growth for the full year. Our 3 Year Price Lock and Free Phone Guarantee is the next phase of our  \\nConsumer transformation. This new offering was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and provides another example of our ability to innovate within the myPlan platform.  \\nTurning to upgrades, the Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 3.0 percent in the first quarter, slightly lower than the prior year. We continue to see customers holding onto their phones for longer periods of time. For the full year, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by mid-single digits from 2024, reflecting an anticipated increase in volumes throughout the balance of the year.  \\nOur offers are resonating in the market. We remain confident that, for the full year 2025, we will deliver year-over-year improvement in Consumer postpaid phone net adds while maintaining our financial discipline.  \\nVerizon Business delivered 67 thousand phone net adds, down from 80 thousand net adds in the prior year period. We continue to evolve our offerings to provide businesses with the network solutions they need.   We recently launched My Biz Plan - a new, innovative plan structure that will better serve small and medium businesses with additional choice, value, and flexibility. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment, delivering strong volumes for the full year 2025.  \\nNow, let me turn to our Core prepaid results where the improved performance more than offset the year-over-year change in total postpaid phone net adds.  \\nCore Prepaid net additions were 137 thousand for the quarter, an improvement of 268 thousand from the prior year. Our strong execution and strategy to invest in the Straight Talk, Visible, and Total Wireless brands continues to pay off.  All three brands are producing strong volume growth, helping us build a high-quality customer base.  \\nMoving on to broadband, we delivered 339 thousand net additions in the quarter. We are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless access offerings.  \\nIn fixed wireless access, we're off to a good start to the year and remain on-track for our 8 to 9 million FWA subscriber target by 2028. We delivered 308 thousand net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 4.8 million subscribers. We see increased opportunity for expansion ahead as we further deploy our C-Band in more suburban and rural areas.  \\nFios internet net adds for the first quarter were 45 thousand versus 53 thousand in the prior year period. Fios continues to be a best-in-class broadband solution, with high levels of customer satisfaction, demonstrated by strong ARPU and continued low levels of churn. We're bringing Fios to more and more communities and are on-track to reach 650 thousand new passings this year.  \\nThe team is also working through the necessary steps to close the pending Frontier acquisition. We continue to expect the deal to close in early 2026. We have received regulatory approvals from several states and are continuing to work with federal and state-level agencies. We are also working through integration planning efforts to ensure a smooth transition upon deal closing. Frontier plays an important role in Verizon's broadband strategy, and we are excited about expanding our fiber footprint and accelerating our broadband growth opportunities.  \\nLooking at our financials, we had a very strong first quarter and maintain a high level of confidence in reaching our financial targets for 2025.  \\nTotal wireless service revenue was 20.8 billion dollars in the first quarter, up 2.7 percent year-overyear. We have taken several actions that have positioned us well for achieving service revenue growth throughout the year.  \\nConsumer ARPA of $146.46 in the first quarter represented an increase of 3.6 percent year-overyear. This was primarily driven by pricing actions implemented over the past year.  \\nAdditionally, the increased adoption of perks and growth in fixed wireless access subscribers continue to drive ARPA.  \\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 12.6 billion dollars, which is the highest we've ever reported and an increase of 4.0 percent compared to the prior year period. The growth was fueled by wireless service revenue coupled with the benefits from cost-saving initiatives.  \\nFrom a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete and we are already realizing run rate savings, which will provide a benefit for the full year. We continue to execute on cost efficiency initiatives to further improve the financial profile of the business. Adjusted EPS was $1.19 in the quarter, up 3.5 percent year over year, primarily due to the strength in Adjusted EBITDA.  \\nTurning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $7.8 billion, an increase of nearly 700 million dollars over the prior year.  The year over year growth in CFFO was primarily driven by the growth in adjusted EBITDA.  \\nCapEx for the quarter came in at 4.1 billion dollars compared to $4.4 billion dollars in the prior year. Consistent with prior years, we expect the pace of capital expenditures to ramp as we get further into the year. We continue to find efficiencies with our C-Band deployment and Fios build out, allowing us to efficiently deliver more solutions within our capital envelope.  \\nFree cash flow was $3.6 billion dollars in the first quarter, up over 900 million dollars, or more than 34 percent, from the prior year.  \\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $115.1 billion dollars, an $11.0 billion dollar improvement year-over-year. This was higher by $1.4 billion dollars sequentially primarily due to non cash mark to market adjustments. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.3 times improvement year over year and in-line with the prior quarter.  \\nOur balance sheet continues to be a key strength of our business. Of note, we have less than 700 million dollars in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. This provides us with a clear pathway for meaningful debt reduction ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction, in alignment with our capital allocation strategy.  \\nIn summary, we are pleased with the financial performance of the business in the first quarter. We delivered strong wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, as well as Free Cash Flow growth.  \\nWe continue to deliver more value to our customers, including our recently launched 3 Year Price Lock and Free Phone Guarantee. The actions we've taken to improve our postpaid phone trends are starting to bear fruit.  \\nCore Prepaid is continuing to perform well and our Broadband base continues to grow.  \\nWe have a recurring business that will remain resilient. Our strong financial results in the first quarter put Verizon in a position of strength to deliver better financial and customer growth in 2025.  \\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you, Tony.  \\nI am proud of our team's performance in this first quarter. We remain focused on our three key financial metrics: growing Wireless Service Revenue, and expanding Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.  \\nWe look forward to sharing more about how we offer more value to our customers and continue to drive both financial and subscriber growth on our 8:30 AM call this morning.\"},\n",

Legacy  legal  matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon\\'s annual goodwill impairment  test.  Legal  settlement  recorded  during  2023  relates  to  the  settlement  of  a  litigation  matter  regarding  certain  administrative  fees.

Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance.

We  believe  that  Consolidated  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Consolidated  Adjusted  EBITDA  Margin  and  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company\\'s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences  in  capital  structure,  taxes,  and  depreciation  and  amortization  policies.  Further,  the  exclusion  of  non-operational  items  and  special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon  Business  Group  (\"Verizon  Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation  costs  and  non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain  businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued  transformation  initiatives. Asset  rationalization  recorded  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023 primarily  relates  to  Verizon  Business  network  assets  that  we  made  a  decision  to  cease  use  of  as  part  of  our  transformation  initiatives.  Legacy  legal  matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon\\'s annual goodwill impairment  test.  Legal  settlement  recorded  during  2023  relates  to  the  settlement  of  a  litigation  matter  regarding  certain  administrative  fees.  Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers.

For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses.

       "        'content': \"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call of the second quarter 2025. Our performance in the first half of the year highlighted by  a  strong  second  quarter  demonstrate  that  our  strategy  is  working.  We  remain  committed  to  disciplined  execution  and  customer-centric innovation. We're growing profitable connections and the value of our customer relationships. While we always see opportunities to improve, I'm confident in the future of our business.  \\nOur financial performance was strong this quarter, with a market-leading wireless service revenue of $20.9 billion, up 2.2% from last year. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year, setting another record for the best reported quarter and the second consecutive quarter with growth exceeding our guided range for the year.  \\nStrong profitability drove free cash flow of $5.2 billion for the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $8.8 billion, an increase of over $300 million compared to the first half of 2024. Our cash flow from operation underscores the strength of our business and provide us flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.  \\nAs a result, we continue to lead in the industry with the nation's best network. Our segmented market strategy, which is a diverse portfolio of offerings is resonating with our customers. Our customer-first offering, such as MyPlan, MyHome and the new My Biz Plan, along with our Best Value Guarantee drove significant sales momentum.  \\nWe're also deploying AI-powered innovations to enhance the customer experience on the nation's best network. On the infrastructure front, our execution is outpacing our targets. C-band deployment is ahead of schedule. Our fixed wireless base has surpassed 5 million subscribers, and our fiber build is tracking ahead of its plan. This demonstrates disciplined execution across our entire portfolio.  \\nGiven our financial performance and the momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We're also raising our guidance for free cash flow for the year, driven by our strong cash flow from operations and further supported by the positive impact from the tax reform. Tony will provide you with more details shortly.  \\nNow, let's turn to our operational performance. In the second quarter, we delivered over 300,000 net additions across our mobility and broadband platforms. In mobility, we delivered year-over-year improvements in the combined postpaid and core prepaid phone net adds, including the fourth consecutive quarter of subscriber growth in core prepaid.  \\nThe wireless market remains competitive, and we continue to take a strategic and segmented approach, maintaining our financial discipline. As expected, postpaid phone churn remained elevated this quarter, reflecting the lingering effects of our pricing actions and ongoing pressure from federal government accounts.  \\nWe're actively focused on improving retention by strengthening our value propositions and leveraging our AI-powered customer experience innovations. On upgrades after being down year-over-year for eight out of the last nine quarters, we saw an uptick in the second quarter, driven by our Best Value Guarantee.  \\nWe continue to expect mid single-digit growth in upgrade activity for the full year. Our dual Fixed Wireless Access and fiber broadband strategy continues to drive market share gains. A key highlight is Fixed Wireless Access, which surpassed the 5 million subscribers milestone, keeping us firmly on the track to achieve our goal of 8 million to 9 million subscribers by 2028.  \\nWe achieved robust broadband growth even as our C-band build-out expands into less dense markets and despite a softer move environment in our Fios footprint. We continue to scale our private network business winning a landmark deal to deploy multiple private 5G networks across the Thames Freeport. This network will serve as a technology foundation for one of UK's busiest commercial corridors, fueling a multibillion-dollar regeneration project with advanced capabilities like AI and real-time logistics.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

While these are often complex deals with longer sales cycles, we're actively engaged in several sizable opportunities.  \\nThis growth highlights the surging demand for high-bandwidth fiber capacity and diverse routes both lit and dark fiber to serve different customer needs. As AI transitions from centralized training to widespread real-time applications, compute power at the network edge becomes essential. Our existing infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support this evolution.  \\nOur network is our key differentiator, consistently delivering top performance. This quarter, J.D. Power once again recognized Verizon for the best network quality and RootMetrics first half year 2025 awards named us the nation's best, fastest, and most reliable 5G network. We're building on this advantage every day.  \\nOur C-band deployment is ahead of schedule and on track to cover 80% to 90% of planned sites by year-end, with nearly all sites now standalone capable. Our fiber build is tracking ahead of plan, and we're positioned to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year.  \\nMeanwhile, the regulatory approval process for our pending acquisition of Frontier is progressing as planned. We're encouraged by Frontier's performance and look forward to closing the transaction to further accelerate our fiber expansion.  \\nAs we near the closing of Frontier acquisition, we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, broadband expansion and capital allocation considering all stakeholders.

       "        'content': 'Thanks, Hans, and good morning. The first half of the year reaffirms the strength of our business, highlighting the effective execution of our disciplined strategy and significant progress towards achieving our financial goals. As a leading provider of essential connectivity across the US, we are committed to offering the best value and delivering the best service and customer experience within the industry.  \\nWe are focused on driving wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow. The second quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong financial results even in a period of elevated promotional activity and broad economic uncertainty.  \\nWe remain focused on high-quality, profitable growth, recognizing that volume growth is only valuable when aligned with our disciplined financial framework. Our goal is to improve volumes year-over-year, but we will not do this at the expense of delivering on our three key financial priorities.  \\nThis past quarter, we achieved strong sales focusing on high-quality customers without overspending for growth. Even with Public Sector challenges and ongoing Consumer postpaid phone churn pressure, we maintained our financial discipline.  \\nWithin Consumer, second quarter postpaid phone gross additions were up sequentially and year-over-year. Our sales execution remains strong, leveraging our attractive value proposition, including the recent launch of the Best Value Guarantee.  \\nAs expected, we saw the residual effects of our first quarter pricing actions impact our second quarter Consumer postpaid phone churn. Additionally, we continue to see elevated competitor promotional activity. As a result, second quarter Consumer postpaid phone churn remained consistent with the first quarter at that 0.90%.  \\nWe have taken a series of actions to address our elevated churn. On June 24, we launched initiatives designed to improve the customer experience, including leveraging AI for more personalized support. In addition, we continue to enhance our value proposition and build customer loyalty through the Best Value Guarantee.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us'},\n",

       "        'content': \"We provide exclusive access to the best events and experiences, and our refreshed app helps customers maximize the value of their plans. Mobility phone net adds, which includes both consumer and business retail postpaid as well as core prepaid, were 16,000 for the second quarter. This represents an improvement of 25,000 from the prior year period.  \\nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 51,000 for the second quarter compared to 109,000 net losses in the prior year period as we benefited from strong gross adds. Verizon Business delivered 42,000 phone net adds in the second quarter compared with 135,000 net adds in the prior year period.  \\nA significant majority of the year-over-year decline was driven by the Public Sector business. Though we anticipate Public Sector pressures to persist in the second half of the year, we expect the impact to subside towards the end of the year.  \\nConsistent with our wireline approach, we continue to remain disciplined and not pursue low-margin wireless business or overpay for volumes. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment and deliver healthy volumes for the full year of 2025.  \\nCore prepaid net additions were 50,000 for the quarter an improvement of 62,000 from the prior year period. This marks four consecutive quarters of positive core prepaid net adds, reflecting the strong execution of the team. The Visible, Total Wireless and Straight Talk brands continue to perform well and are progressively building a high-quality business.  \\nOverall, core prepaid ARPU rose above $32 and we have now reached an inflection point where after four quarters of volume growth, we expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth for the remainder of the year.  \\nTurning to total wireless postpaid upgrades. We saw a 14% increase in the first half of the year as compared to the same period of 2024. This result was driven by a healthy initial uptake of our Best Value Guarantee program, which is an investment in our high-quality customer base. As Hans said earlier, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by a mid single-digit percentage in 2025 as compared to 2024.  \\nMoving on to broadband. We delivered 293,000 net additions in the quarter. We are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and Fixed Wireless Access offerings, even with seasonal impacts and a softer move environment as compared to prior years.  \\nIn Fixed Wireless Access, we delivered 278,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 5.1 million subscribers. FWA demand remains strong, and we are on track to deliver our goal of 8 million to 9 million FWA subscribers by 2028.  \\nFios internet net adds for the second quarter were 32,000 versus 28,000 in the prior year period. Fios provides customers with industry leading connectivity and delivers high customer satisfaction reflected in both robust ARPU and consistently low churn rates. We are expanding our Fios footprint and remain on track to deliver 650,000 new passings in 2025.  \\nAs we talk about fiber, let me provide a brief update on the pending Frontier transaction. The team is working through the necessary steps to complete the acquisition, and we remain on track for an early 2026 close. We have received regulatory approvals from eight states as well as the FCC and DOJ and are productively engaged with the remaining state regulatory agencies.  \\nBased on Frontier's publicly reported results, the company continues to perform extremely well and remains on track with their fiber expansion goals. Our integration planning efforts are well underway, and we anticipate a smooth transition upon the deal closing. We are looking forward to having Frontier's assets serve as an important catalyst for our fiber expansion and broadband growth acceleration.  \\nTurning to our financial results. We delivered another strong quarter. Second quarter consolidated revenue reached $34.5 billion, up 5.2% year over year. This result was driven by solid wireless service revenue and a more than 25% increase in wireless equipment revenue. Services and other revenue rose 1.6%. Total wireless service revenue reached $20.9 billion in the second quarter, a 2.2% increase year over year.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \\nGrowth was driven by consumer ARPA, which rose 2.3% year over year. We realized benefits from recent pricing actions, expansion of Fixed Wireless Access, and increased revenue from perks and other adjacent services. Our robust perk offerings continue to grow at a steady pace, keeping us on track to achieve our goal of 15 million perks by year end and providing a healthy contribution to service revenue.  \\nIn addition, prepaid revenue has reached a turning point and was flat in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. We expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we are well positioned for continued service revenue growth with healthy underlying customer economics.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.8 billion which is the highest we have ever reported and an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year period. Wireless service revenue growth coupled with the benefits from cost savings initiatives more than offset the impact from the elevated upgrade activity.  \\nThrough the first half of 2025, both wireless service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are up nearly $1 billion from the prior year, reflecting strong operating leverage. Within that result, the Business segment EBITDA has now grown for three consecutive quarters on a year over year basis.  \\nFrom a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete, generating substantial savings. In addition, we're actively pursuing opportunities within our legacy businesses. These include copper decommissioning and savings from the managed services initiative within our business segment, among other cost efficiency programs. Adjusted EPS was $1.22 in the quarter, up 6.1% year over year, primarily due to the strength in Adjusted EBITDA.  \\nTurning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of the year was $16.8 billion, up more than 1% compared with the same period a year ago. CapEx for the first half of 2025 came in at $8 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year period. We continue to realize efficiencies in our C-band deployment and Fios expansion, enabling us to effectively meet or exceed our network goals well within our capital budget.  \\nFor the first half of the year, the net effect of Cash flow from operations and CapEx resulted in free cash flow of $8.8 billion, an increase of 3.6% compared to the same period a year ago. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $116 billion, a $6.9 billion improvement year over year. In the first half of the year, our debt reduction was offset by non-cash mark to market adjustments.  \\nOur net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.2 times improvement year over year and in line with the prior quarter. We continue to make progress towards our long-term leverage target ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction.  \\nOur balance sheet remains a significant strength of our organization. Notably, we have under $700 million in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. We will continue to focus on reducing debt ahead of completing the Frontier transaction.  \\nAs Hans mentioned earlier, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will continue to strategically invest in the business, enhancing our mobile and broadband networks, support a healthy and growing dividend and paying down debt towards our long-term leverage target.  \\nAs we've mentioned previously, we'll consider buybacks once we reach our leveraged target. Our strong operational execution in the first half of the year coupled with favorable tax reform gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for the full year.  \\nGiven the strong Adjusted EBITDA performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year guidance to 2.5% to 3.5% growth, an increase of approximately $125 million at the midpoint.  \\nWe are increasing our guidance for Adjusted EPS growth to a range of 1% to 3% to reflect a new Adjusted EBITDA outlook.  \\nWe are raising our 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion. The increase is driven by an estimated benefit of $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the recently enacted tax legislation as well as the disciplined operational execution that drove our strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance in the first half of the year.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \\nOur wireless service revenue and CapEx guidance remains unchanged. As we get closer to the closing of the Frontier transaction, we expect to provide an update on our broadband plans as well as our capital allocation strategy.  \\nIn summary, we have a resilient business model with a high-quality customer base and continue to execute well on both mobility and broadband. Our second quarter financial performance reflects our disciplined approach to growth, and we are well positioned to deliver on our improved outlook in the second half of the year.  \\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you, Tony. Our strong first half results reaffirm our confidence in Verizon's strategy. Our strategic execution and the ongoing momentum across our business underpin our decision to raise full year guidance. Our focus remains clear. We are committed to growing wireless service revenue, expanding Adjusted EBITDA and generating strong free cash flow.  \\nWe will achieve this through three key priorities. First, building on our network leadership to create compelling customer offerings that accelerate growth in our mobility and broadband businesses. Secondly, maintaining operational excellence and financial discipline across the organization.  \\nThirdly, scaling our next-generation platforms from capturing new enterprise opportunities with private networks to enabling AI at scale and unlocking new revenue streams from our existing assets.  \\nThe opportunities ahead are significant and the pending Frontier acquisition will accelerate our fiber strategy.  \\nVerizon's unique market position and the essential nature of our services are fundamental to empowering individuals, businesses and society. Verizon has the assets, the strategy, and most importantly, the team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunities ahead.  \\nWith that, Brady, it's time for Q&amp;A.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Hans.

       "        'content': \"Thank you. Let me start with the capital allocation. I think your comments and question there is more than valid. As you saw, we raised our guidance for free cash flow, partly because of our cash flow from operation is improving, but also the tax reform that we indicated on how much it is.  \\nAs I said before, I mean, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. I mean it's, first of all, in our business, and we have increased the CapEx this year compared to 2024. The dividend, of course, 18 years of increase. We want to put the Board in a position to continue to grow. We paid down our debt. We paid down our debt again with almost $3 billion in the first half, and then it will be buybacks.  \\nNow, we are in a situation where we are getting closer to the expected (corrected by company after the call)next year closing of Frontier. So what I said in my prepared remarks is I want to get a holistic view on all the capital allocation. I mean how we're going to invest in fiber, what synergies we see, how we're going to do the capital allocation priorities.  \\nBut clearly, the tax reform is helping us to get faster to the priorities we have. So we feel good about that. But let me come back to that. So I think we can give you a holistic view on capital allocation. But clearly, we're very excited about Frontier. The performance is great. The synergies are great. And of course, the convergence and the fiber opportunities are also great. So very excited for that. And so far, Frontier has performed really good.  \\nOn the wireless consumer, I think that our ambition as was outlined by Sampath in the beginning of the year doing better this year is still valid. I mean there's no difference on that. However, we're going to continue to be very financially disciplined.  \\nFor us, we will not sacrifice our financials, but you're still getting net adds if it doesn't make sense. If it's too expensive. You saw us in the fourth quarter last year being aggressive because we saw the opportunities of creating and gaining a lot of high-quality customers.  \\nYou saw our gross adds in second quarter. So it all depends on where the market is and where we go, but ultimately, our goal is to increase our service revenue and then expand our Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. That's our main KPIs.  \\nAnd then on churn, Tony will probably chime in on all of this. But on churn, expected in the second quarter was elevated coming from the prices, but also from the competitive environment. I think the whole industry is up, Sampath put in a lot of very important churn measurements, 624. That now is working going through our system. All our AI-empowered customer service impacting.  \\nSo very encouraged about what the team is doing and how they are working on the loyalty and retention of our customers. So that's all. A little bit Tony will chime in on all three, I guess.  \\nAnthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \\nYeah. Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Ben. So a couple of things on churn. Obviously, we're focused on reducing churn in a financially disciplined manner. And as Hans mentioned, we have a great value proposition with the Verizon value guarantee and also My Biz on the business side.  \\nWe have further deployment of C-band. We said we're going to get to 80% to 90% of C-band this year deployed, and we see lower churn where C-band is deployed. And then the work that Hans mentioned on customer experience, we did a CX launch on June 24. And that work is also augmented by AI, and we expect to see improvements there. And then obviously, convergence will also reduce mobility churn. And the team has the retention tools to get there, and they're focused on it.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

Thanks.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you. On the postpaid ARPA, I think, again, I mean, we have been growing our ARPA for a long time, and we continue to.

You heard when we had our prepared remarks on our perks basically doubling this year, up to 15 million perks. So we have a lot of drivers for it. So we still believe that we have a good run rate on that.  \\nOn the upgrades, as you articulated, we have been down eight quarters of the last nine when it comes to upgrades for many reasons. This quarter, we put in, first of all, a couple of incentives for customers to upgrade. So that's why we saw a little bit higher.

Curious if you could share an update on how Verizon is progressing with the uptake of these converged bundles within the base. And if you can share how Verizon is looking to differentiate your converged offers versus the competition.  \\nAnd then on EBITDA, you referenced that it was up 4% in the second quarter, first half and that's better than the guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. So can you unpack within the full year guidance, like what you're anticipating for the rest of the year? And what are the factors that would put you at the high end versus the low end of that range?\"},\n",

But on the convergence, I think that, of course, our main key differentiator is that we have owner's economics on mobility and broadband. We have the biggest mobility base and we're now adding our fiber base with Frontier.  \\nSo we're going to have an unparalleled opportunity for convergence that our customers have a chance to work on both. And as I said before, we have a very high degree of our broadband net adds per quarter that are already converged.  \\nSo it's more about when we're going to scale that opportunity, we have even more chances and if you think about coming into the Frontier footprint when that's approved, we have a huge opportunity for convergence. So we're excited over that and that's our offering.  \\nAnd on EBITDA, before Tony says something, I think you see right now our leverage, the cost takes out we've done, the growth we're doing and it's falling straight down to the bottom line and we will continue to focus on that. As I said so many times before, the whole executive management and the whole company had three KPIs. It's the wireless service revenue growth, and then it's Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation. So very good start of the year.\"},\n",

       "        'content': \"Thanks, Hans. Hey, Mike. So on the Adjusted EBITDA, we were up over $500 million in the quarter and about $1 billion of Adjusted EBITDA growth year-to-date, and that's also in light of having a pretty significant upgrade activity mostly driven by the launch of our Value Guarantee.  \\nAnd we stayed very disciplined in the quarter. We didn't chase volumes. And they gave us the confidence that resiliency in the business gave us the confidence to raise the guide. And it starts with the top line revenue and wireless service revenue is up 2.4% year-to-date. So we're seeing great operating leverage, as Hans mentioned.  \\nAnd there's a lot of work going on the cost side of the house to continue to make the business a lot more efficient in serving customers day in and day out. If you think about the customer care and the work we launched on June 24, that includes having AI enabled customer care, managed services.  \\nWe're seeing great progress now with the managed services work that Kyle and the team are doing, and we're seeing good savings here ramping up in 2025. The network team continues to take out cost and legacy network elements that includes copper decommissioning and that work is ongoing.  \\nAnd then even in Business Wireline, we continue to de-emphasize low-margin deals and stay very disciplined there. And then from a headcount standpoint, the voluntary separation program is now behind us, and we're seeing a full run rate benefit for the balance of the year.  \\nSo there's really no assumption changes in upgrades, as you asked before. We said mid single-digits for the full year. That still stays intact. And what we've said is volumes are important, but we're going to stay disciplined in our approach and in support of the three measures that Hans mentioned wireless service revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"},\n",

I know you pulse in and out of the market, Tony, just like you said, but looking through some of your postpaid offers in the second quarter, at times, there seems to have been a bit more promotional activity on the device side, targeting the value end.  \\nOver the last few years, you've expanded your portfolio in the segments that you target with TracFone and Fixed Wireless, for example. But the value end had historically been perhaps less of a focus on the postpaid side.

We are running now, I think, eight or nine different brands. All of them have different brand attributes and appealing to different segmentations.  \\nSo this is sort of a segmented growth strategy we have in wireless for Consumer, and that will continue. And you just refine and see that we have the right offerings in all the different type of brands we have. I would say some of the brands are doing extraordinary well. I mean, Total Wireless, Visible, very good, very targeted. Some of them have some sort of promotions. Some of them are just having a service fee.  \\nSo it's very different, and you're going to see us continue doing that work because that is part of our growth story that we can actually meet any consumer with different economical background with the service.

And by next year, we're going to have basically built all our C-band on top of the grid we defined from the beginning. And after that, we can always debate how we're going to continue to allocate capital.  \\nBut right now, we allocate capital for mobility for the simple reason that where we build the C-band, we have better step ups, we have better upgrades from our customers. So that's the number one. But let us finish this and then we're going to see, but the pace has not changed, the same C-band build-out.  \\nWhat you see on the CapEx is actually also an efficiency work.

Under the new budget or the One Big, Beautiful Bill, there is an expectation of significant spectrum sales, even though the spectrum hasn't been identified, can you just talk a little bit about that as to how you would prioritize spectrum purchases. If there's either a government action or alternatively if private market spectrum comes available from EchoStar as to how that might affect, for example, your discussion about possible share buybacks.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you. When it comes to spectrum, I mean, I think that what we are -- we're sitting on a really good position on spectrum and with a C-band, millimeter wave, or a low band, and that's what you see we are deploying right now. So we feel good about where we are with spectrum.  \\nThen I've said all the time that the US over time needs more spectrum, especially as 6G comes up, et cetera, in order to stay competitive and being the most digitalized country in the world. So we're, of course, thinking is good. That's part of the bill. But as you rightfully said, it still needs to be freeing up spectrum and all of that, and that will take some time.  \\nWhen it comes to in general capital allocation of spectrum, we always do the build versus buy. I mean, we have done it way before I joined. We look into will this -- buy the spectrum being better than building our own spectrum today. That's the comparison of what it's going to do when we see spectrum in the market.\"},\n",

       "        'content': \"Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \\nOkay. Sure, Greg. On the gross adds, a couple of things here. The strength came from two places. First, we had very strong sales execution in our stores and distribution. The team did a great job. And then secondly, the value proposition when you think about -- we launched the Best Value Guarantee back at the beginning of April, and that is resonating with customers in the market.  \\nAnd we see a healthy mix of new to Verizon in the quarter, and we're also writing good business as well. And what we said many times is volumes are important, and we'll pulse in and pulse out where it makes financial sense. And then as we said earlier, the biggest opportunity for us is loyalty and retention, and the team is focused on it.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nYeah. And if we talk about what was launch 624, I think that it was a lot of AI supported customer experience tools we put in. I mean, first of all, when it comes to the process, we now will have a customer care employee following a request or a complaint from our customers all the way. So we actually finish it out with the same person starting and ending and also having uptake. That was a concern for our customers that we heard through the year and that we needed to improve.  \\nThe other thing is we're also opening up for our customer service 24/7, very important. Again, that was a feedback that people are having different work hours. They want to call different times. We're going to fix that. And then, of course, we're giving our customer care employees an AI tool so they can treat our customer better and know their problems better because this could be stressful. We know that having the connectivity is such an essential service mobility in broadband.  \\nAnd then the last thing, we're going to leverage even more our stores. I mean, 93% of the US population has less than 30 minutes of Verizon store. We're going to leverage that more, see that's going to be a place where you can get more support and help as well. So we leverage all the assets and all our employees to see that we're treating our customers better.  \\nAnd I think it's an area we can excel in, and then we basically have worked a lot on our product side, where we have MyPlan, My Biz, MyHome, all of that with perks, which is really resonating. We have worked on a brand that we refreshed the brand last year, and that is actually going really good as well. And the network is, of course, the best network in the market that once again was proven by J.D. Power and RootMetrics.  \\nSo we're working on all the cylinders how we compete for any type of customer all the way from enterprise government, small and medium to prepaid, postpaid customers, and broadband and mobility. So it's a holistic thinking how we're going to do this. Thank you for the question.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Greg.

The customer protection starts out of the box with no intervention or policy creation needed. The software also helps protect customers from going to malicious websites (including phishing and malware sites), provides router protection from hackers, and segments the network preventing lateral attacks.

Service Description **  \\nPremium DSL is a high-speed symmetrical (upstream and downstream data rates are equal) data-only access service. Premium DSL also features static IP Addressing, Variable Bit Rate Non-Real Time Quality of Service and support for multiple users. The service uses DSL technology to transport data over compatible facilities to an end user premises. Data traffic generated by a customer-provided modem is transported to the Verizon Premium DSL Connection Point. From there, the traffic is transported to the end user's Information Service Provider (ISP) or content provider via other Telephone Company services.  \\n**A. **Static IP Addressing - The Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to a computer never changes. The static IP address becomes the permanent address of the computer on the internet, making it possible for other Internet users to locate and connect to the computer.\"),\n",

Asset rationalization recorded  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  primarily  relates  to  Verizon  Business  network  assets  that  we  made  a  decision  to  cease  use  of  as  part  of  our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon\\'s annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain  administrative  fees.  Business  transformation  costs  recorded  during  2023  primarily  relate  to  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  strategic  partnership initiatives  in  our  managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers.

While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our  newly  acquired  and  long-held  businesses,  and  with  both  acquisitive  and  non-acquisitive  peer  companies.  We  believe  that  it  is  important  for  investors  to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets.  \\nWe have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025.\"),\n",

We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.  \\nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities.

Further,  the exclusion of  non-operational  items  and special  items  enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is  calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy  legal  matter,  Verizon Business  Group (\"Verizon Business\")  goodwill  impairment,  legal  settlement,  business  transformation costs  and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit nonstrategic  portions  of  certain businesses,  as  part  of  our  continued transformation initiatives. Asset  rationalization recorded during the second quarter  of  2023 relates to certain real  estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of  as  part  of  our  transformation initiatives. Asset  rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter  of  2023 primarily  relates  to Verizon Business  network  assets  that  we made a decision to cease use of  as  part  of  our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon\\'s annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business  transformation costs  recorded during 2023 primarily  relate to costs  incurred in connection with strategic  partnership initiatives  in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of  our BlueJeans business offering in 2023.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated operating revenues.  \\nWe have not  provided a reconciliation for  our  Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast  because we cannot,  without  unreasonable effort,  predict  the special items that could arise during 2025.'),\n",

We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or  expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it  is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.  \\nFree cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities.

Good morning, everyone. Let me start by addressing the evolving policy and macroeconomic landscape. We continue to monitor the ongoing developments, and we're confident in our ability to effectively manage our business for our customers and shareholders.  \\nIn periods of heightened uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength, given the importance and the essential nature of our connectivity services, the size and quality of our customer base, and the strength of our balance sheet.  \\nOur diverse portfolio of offerings serves all market segments and positions us for success in any economic environment. And with our bias for action and position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment but thrive in it.  \\nNow let me turn to our results. We had an exceptional financial start of the year delivering strong growth across our key financial metrics. Wireless service revenue was up 2.7% at the high end of our guided range. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 billion was our highest reported result ever, growing 4% and exceeding our guided range.  \\nFree cash flow was up over $900 million and enabled continued execution of our capital allocation priorities. Even with the recent declines in consumer confidence, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance.  \\nOur comprehensive portfolio of offerings and strategic moves we have made over the last year position as well for sustainable financial and subscriber growth while also improving the customer experience.  \\nThese moves include our brand refresh along with continuous evolution of customer first offerings such as myPlan, myHome, and My Biz Plan, organic and inorganic broadband expansion with the pending acquisition of Frontier, AI Connect and satellite partnerships that enables texting anywhere for free.  \\nRootMetrics recently recognized Verizon as the best, fastest and most reliable 5G network in the US, and our network continues to get even better. On mobility, we're on track to deploy C-band to 80% to 90% of our planned sites by year end, and we are aggressively rolling out 5G advanced features.  \\nOn Fios expansion, we're ahead of our plan year-to-date to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year. On fixed wireless access, our multi-dwelling unit solution is expected to gradually ramp over time along with continued expansion of homes and businesses covered with ongoing C-band deployment.  \\nTurning to our operation performance, our segmentation strategy focused on delivering targeted offerings is yielding positive results. We delivered a year-on-year improvement in combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds. We did have a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn due to recent price ups and pressure from federal government accounts.  \\nHowever, our prepaid nets adds of 137,000 were the best since the TracFone acquisition. In broadband, we continue to take share. With fixed wireless access and fiber, we have the most complete offering covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over the time.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"),\n",

Now, let's discuss our strategic approach to the consumer market to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth. It all starts with how we compete and go to market. Our network is the foundation of everything we offer. We have the best and most reliable network, and we continue to extend our network leadership with our ongoing C-band deployment and broadband expansion with fixed wireless access and fiber, including the pending acquisition of Frontier.  \\nOur customer-first connectivity offerings deliver unmatched control, value and simplicity for all our customer segments. Over the last two years, we have introduced targeted offers for all customer segments across mobility and broadband. As the market leader, we remain committed to introducing new and innovative offerings that meet the evolving needs of our customers.  \\nNext is the value-added services, which is one of our key differentiators in the market. We offer add-on perks including exclusive discounts on some of the top streaming services such as Netflix and Max. Given the size and the quality of our base and the scale of our distribution network, we offer rates that customers cannot find anywhere else, and we will continue to expand our perk portfolio.  \\nOver the past few years, we have dedicated substantial resources and capital to enhance our customer experience through various initiatives including AI for customer care and personalization. Although the industry, including Verizon still has room to improve, we have made great progress towards our goal of seamless customer interactions.  \\nLastly, our brand is a pivotal element in our go-to-market strategy. Recognizing its importance, we made a strategic decision to refresh our brand last year, and we are committed to further developing and strengthening our brand to drive continued growth and customer engagement.  \\nBy focusing on these key pillars of our value proposition, we attract new customers, foster loyalty among existing ones and maximize the long-term value of each customer relationship. This holistic approach ensures that we remain competitive in the marketplace and drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth.  \\nNow, let me turn to Sampath, who will provide more details on our consumer transformation journey.\"),\n",

Beginning in 2023, we revamped our sales engine, moving to a regional model, individual sales incentives and a stronger focus on local marketing.

We also turned around our prepaid business, which includes the industry's largest portfolio of brands. This was driven by a revamp of our value propositions, expanded exclusive and third-party distribution, and instilling the same operational rigor we introduced in our postpaid business.  \\nThe core prepaid brands returned to subscriber growth in 2024 and achieved their best results since the TracFone acquisition this quarter. This demonstrates our ability to win across all market segments. Customers are responding to our offers and we anticipate gaining market share in prepaid this year.  \\nAs we enter year three, we are doubling down on our customer-first strategy with an increased focus on customer retention with the Verizon value guarantee, and industry leading 3-year price lock, free phone guarantee for everyone and savings you cannot get elsewhere.  \\nBefore  I  dive  into  the  Verizon  value  guarantee,  let  us  quickly  recap  what  makes  our  offering  stand  out  from  the  competition.  Our  strategic differentiation centers on creating real customer value through a unique combination of network superiority and customer first offerings. Our myPlan and myHome offerings have been the key drivers of our transformation.  \\nThese offerings go beyond basic connectivity to include premium entertainment and adjacent services that deliver significant savings for the customer. Today, you can get8 of the most popular streaming services from Verizon for $50. That is value customers can only get at Verizon.  \\nOur portfolio of adjacent services include industry leading insurance products for both mobility and the connected home and give customers even more peace of mind. We offer even more ways to save through our financial service partners and products, including the Verizon Visa card and the Openbank high yield savings account with Santander, both exclusive to Verizon customers. This business is growing at a double-digit rate and bringing in margin rich service revenue.  \\nFinally, we launched Verizon Access loyalty program, giving customers access to events like the exclusive pre-sale of 100,000 Beyonce concert tickets, NFL, NBA and NHL games, and lifetime experiences such as the 140,000 free tickets we gave out to the first Verizon Super Bowl fanfest parties.  \\nThere is no other plan in the industry like myPlan in myHome, and the beauty of having them built side by side is our ability to offer seamless account linkage and promote joint offers. For converged customers, our retention rates are significantly better than those with just mobility or broadband validating our convergence strategy.  \\nSimply put, we offer the most differentiated value proposition in the industry and with our recently launched offers for both new and existing customers, we are delivering what people want and need on their terms.  \\nSo now let's turn to what we announced a few weeks ago. We launched a game-changing offer, a 3-year price lock and a free phone guarantee with trade in for new and existing customers. This offer was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and is a key component of our strategy to deliver sustainable growth.  \\nThe premise of this offer began several quarters ago as emerging consumer trends showed a growing desire for predictability, price control and value. All things that are particularly relevant in today's economic environment. Customers want peace of mind, and we are giving them just that.  \\nThe key elements of this offer include a 3-year price lock guarantee that covers the network portion of all tiers of myPlan and myHome, and current customers were automatically enrolled on day one. Guaranteed trade in credit for phones to new and existing customers within their plan tiers, free satellite text messaging on all plans. Customers should not have to pay for texting, and it's part of the value we provide to our customers.  \\nCustomers love our perks and the massive savings they deliver. We had over 10 million perk subscriptions at the end of the first quarter. We now anticipate 15 million subscriptions on our platform by the end of this year, an increase of 1 million perks from our prior forecast in the year-end 2025.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \\nThey love getting more value for their money with Verizon Visa card and Openbank high-yield savings account. And customers with both mobile and home services get a free monthly perk that will drive customer loyalty. We did not just launch an offer, we set a new standard for customer value, and customers are responding very well.  \\nEarly indicators in April suggest strong gross add momentum and very good reception from customers, including many new customers attracted to Verizon. We expect the Verizon value guarantee to provide many benefits to Verizon.  \\nFirst, growth. We will continue to drive revenue through higher volumes, higher premium mix, perk adoption and upgrading customers to myPlan. All of that is in addition to revenue benefits from a growing FWA base along with the wholesale business and the momentum with prepaid, which we expect to turn service revenue positive in the second half of the year.  \\nSecond, better customer retention. In the past, we've made necessary price adjustments, which impacted churn, but we expect trends to improve through the year, and this launch puts us on a path to get back to the lowest churn in the industry over time.  \\nAnd third, we have constructed this offer in a flexible manner to give us continued financial discipline. The price lock applies to myPlan and myHome network plans only. It doesn't apply to perks, discounts, taxes or fees, and we can still adjust price on legacy plans or introduce new plans if we see an opportunity in the market. Another important note is that the free phone offer will be tiered by plan and require a device trade-in.  \\nOverall, we believe this is just the beginning of how we'll earn lasting customer loyalty and continue to grow the Verizon base, including deliver better consumer postpaid phone net adds in 2025 compared to 2024. We are back to leading the market, not reacting to it, and we are the only carrier with the brand portfolio covering every price point, positioning us for further growth across every segment of the market.  \\nThe 3-year price lock guarantee is the next phase in our consumer transformation, giving consumers the best network, value and 24/7 support with myPlan and myHome, plus additional peace of mind with the free phone and satellite texting. We want to be people's first choice, providing products, services and experience they can't get elsewhere.  \\nWith that, let me turn back to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you, Sampath. In summary, we are on plan with our multi-year consumer transformation. We're offering the most differentiated value proposition, and we are well positioned to drive subscriber and financial growth.  \\nI'm incredibly proud of the team's dedication and efforts transforming the business. I'm confident that the actions we are taking will set the business up for sustainable long-term growth and extend our industry leadership.  \\nNow, Brady, we are ready for questions.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Hans.

Let me talk about the tariffs. Of course, tariffs is a little bit of a moving target where they are. But if we take our capital expenditures, it's a very small portion of the [$18 billion], which is the midpoint of the guide this year that it is exposed to tariffs. And on top of that, we are working with all our suppliers, as we have done so.  \\nI mean, during COVID-19, we had no impact at all with the supply chain issues there were because I think my team is the best in the industry to handle that. So that will not change any type of investments we're doing in CapEx or anything. We cannot foresee that.  \\nWhen it comes to handsets, that's also, of course, very early to say where the tariff is going to go and what's going to happen. But in general, if the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we are not planning to cover that in our work.  \\nThat's just not going to be possible. So we will continue to be with financial discipline in whatever promotions we have, but we will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handset. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market. But again, it's too early to say. We don't know where tariff is going to go.  \\nBut I think my team is well prepared for handling all of it. And on the consumer side, I think Sampath has talked quite a lot about it. I think that the team has done a tremendous work with doing all the new proposals and the new promotions we had all the way from myPlan and myHome home and all of that.  \\nAnd now we come to the third leg with the price lock and the phone guarantee. I think we're right in the moment, and we're leading from a very strong financial position. But I'll let Sampath talk a little bit more about the churn and where we are there.\"),\n",

If you think about the mix of business shifting more wireless now, Kyle and the team have been growing both mobility and FWA for many quarters now.  \\nSo that mix shift is skewing more wireless.

Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first off, on the consumer side, maybe Sampath or Hans, you could talk to the broad behavior you're seeing from consumers from March into April.

I mean, maybe how are you thinking about that, the impact of the sort of knock-on impact of tariffs on consumer behavior. Anything you're seeing in terms of the deterioration of consumer in terms of health, credit metrics or whatnot?  \\nAnd then maybe as a second question, can you maybe just sort of talk about following on the business EBITDA question. I mean, that really sticks out to me as the best growth you've seen in quite some time. Can you maybe talk about the cost metrics underlying that?

When it comes to consumer behavior, I mean, in general, we haven't seen any major consumer shifts in behavior, even though we read the same articles that everybody else that consumer sentiment come back or coming down. Of course, we have a product, the mobility and broadband. It's so essential for our consumers and for our business customers because it's just relevant. So we haven't seen that.  \\nAnd Tony can talk a little about the payments as well, but they are continue very intact, no deterioration on payments. And then there have been speculation also of any growth in handsets due to worries for tariffs. I think what we can see, and I think Sampath can talk about it is that we have seen a somewhat uptick.  \\nBut I think it comes more from our offering that we start with a new 3-year price lock-in as well as that we had any phone guarantee trade-in. I think that has driven a little bit more handsets for us, not per se. But maybe Sampath and Tony will talk a little bit, and Tony will talk about the margin as well. So let's start with Sampath about the momentum there.  \\nSowmyanarayan Sampath - Verizon Communications Inc - Executive Vice President and CEO of Verizon Consumer Group  \\nLook, we have good momentum in our business that March and April were very strong, and April have double-digit growth there. We're seeing good premium mix, in other words, a portion of our base new customers that is taking our premium plans. That mix has actually grown higher.  \\nSo that suggests that a value prop is resonating well and customers like what we offer. In terms of upgrades, look, Q1 was a bit soft, and we didn't chase volumes where there was no demand, we didn't think it made sense for us to chase volumes there.  \\nFor the whole year, I think we're still committing to a mid single-digit growth in overall upgrade. There will be some volatility quarter-to-quarter as that works through. As we come into April, there will be some pent-up demand mostly from the Verizon value guarantee. Customers really like that. So they're going to take advantage of that. But overall, for the year, we still think mid single-digit growth for upgrade holds. Tony?\"),\n",

Look, I don't want to use -- this is not the time to discuss future pricing. So what I will talk about more is wireless service revenue and how we think about it in the medium term. As far as the Verizon value guarantee, it was contemplated in our '25 guidance. But let me talk about some of the puts and takes that we have in our wireless revenue.  \\nThe first is higher volumes. We'll have higher volumes in '25 compared to '24, and that will help with wireless service revenue. Second is only 50% of our base is on myPlan with the Verizon value guarantee, there are more incentives for customers to migrate to my plan, which tends to be accreted to revenue immediately.  \\nLonger term, look, we have step-ups. There's a lot of value in our ultimate high-end plan, including an upgrade to unlimited hotspot, which we did last week, and it's really helping with the premium mix. Perks is another area that we'll continue to grow. We had said that we'll get to 14 million perks by the end of this year. I'm happy to say that I think we have line of sight to 15 million perks, an increase of 1 million perks by the time the year ends.  \\nFWA, look, that's a place for good, strong service revenue growth, both on volume, but also on ARPU with a much higher premium mix that we had planned. Value on our prepaid business, historically, has been a drag on our service revenue.  \\nIn 2024, it was a 0.8% drag on our overall service revenue. We expect that to turn positive in the second half as volumes grow nicely, and that will help with the long-term service revenue growth. The last is our wholesale business. It has healthy service revenue growth margin in it. So those are all the different levers that we have at our disposal to drive long-term wireless service revenue growth, and we are very comfortable with sustained growth in our business.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Peter.

On the fiber, we're already ramping up right now our fiber deployment, and that's contemplated in our CapEx from [$450 million OFS to $650 million]. That's ongoing. And our focus right now is, of course, to close Frontier.  \\nAnd when we have Frontier closed, we have said initially as we didn't have all the data, that plus 1 million OFS a year should be what we're targeting and plus means plus. We haven't defined in that we need to get closer to the closing to give you an update, and we will do that.  \\nSo we are very focused on that and see that we're doing the right thing. And then on convergence, the only thing I would say, first of all, I think we have owner economics on everything in broadband and mobility, which means that we have a great position on convergence. And a big portion, I would say, the majority and maybe Sampath can comment on it.  \\nIf you take the majority of all the customers coming in on broadband this quarter, they're [mostly] (corrected by company after the call) converged.

And I hope that you're not using a Verizon line because it was a little bit wobbly. Anyhow, I think I heard your question. And the first one was around the long-term plan of 35 million to 40 million fiber coverings. Yeah. That's the long-term plan we have. And again, we did that communication when we just had made the offer to acquire Frontier.  \\nWe are, of course, in the planning stage right now and of course, working through the regulatory approvals. As soon as we get more clarity and closer to the closing of Frontier, we will do more updates where we are and timing, et cetera. And secondly, I would say, everything with the Frontier transaction is going as planned. Our plan is to close it in the first quarter.  \\nSo that is going according to plan, but we are in the planning stage right now as we have not that acquired entity in our hands. But as soon as we are closing in on that, we will have more updates where we are. But that was a long-term number we gave when we made the acquisition.  \\nWhen it comes to spectrum, I think, first of all, we have a really good position on spectrum. I think the C-band and the millimeter wave positions that we have is really yielding. And we have talked about it on previous calls that when we deploy C-band, we have lower churn, better step-ups.  \\nWe are creating fixed wireless access opportunities. So it is really making a difference for us. So the second-hand market or spectrum is always coming in and out. We always do an evaluation if it makes sense for us to buy it. It's a buy versus build, but I don't see any major second-hand market spectrum coming up.  \\nI think it's more important long term for the US government for the competitiveness of the US to actually bringing out spectrum over time in order for the carriers to continue to grow. And I think that we all are aligned at that in the industry, it's going to be important.  \\nBut that's not a short-term issue, not even medium for us. But over long term, US need to come up with spectrum to continue to compete, especially with 5G advanced and 6G coming later on.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nBrad, ready for the next question.\"),\n",

What we are seeing is, look, it's a normal market on broadband. It is competitive.

And on Fios, we lead with just incredible reliability and performance.  \\nThat segmentation strategy is working well, and we are growing on both sides. That's why we had a very strong quarter at 339,000 broadband net adds for both consumer and business.  \\nOn churn, Fios had its best churn in a very, very long time this quarter and it goes back to the strong NPS customer satisfaction and reliability of the fiber plant. On FWA, we are seeing sequential improvement in churn, which is really important for us as the product matures, and we get more comfortable, and customers get more comfortable with the piece.  \\nIn terms of ARPU, we are seeing good ARPU growth across both Fios and our FWA products. Two things are happening. One is we're getting better price realization. Two is a better premium mix in terms of higher-end plans on FWA and 1 gig-plus plant on Fios. A combination of those two is giving us good ARPU growth in the pace.  \\nSo overall, it's a really good market for us. We are doing extremely well.

I mean, I don't see anything else if the industry is coming back or not. I think this is related to us how we perform.  \\nAnd remember, this is a plan that Sampath and his team together with our CMO has had for a long time to take the next step with our offering, and it resonates with our customers because, I mean, whatever we have learned from our customer is that they want the control or predictability about the offerings, they want the simplicity of the offers and they want the value and we're hitting on all three of them.  \\nSo I think that maybe Sampath can comment after this, but I can talk about the MDU. Yeah, we have launched the MDU solution in more than 15 markets. And of course, in the beginning, you start with certain high rises.  \\nAnd this is, of course, a Fios work. You need to see that the landlords in every house is accepting our solution and then you can sell it into the whole household. So of course, we are working in parallel with a technical solution as well as seeing that we are opening up more and more MDUs. And that is going to roll out over the year.  \\nAnd it's both for the business side, but I would say, mainly by the consumer side, this is opening up. We have different type of solutions on technology, both on Fios like performance down to fixed wireless access performance. And that's how we're going to work it because ultimately, we want to give choice for our customers for different type of speed tiers as we did the fixed wireless access, et cetera.  \\nSo this is going to ramp over the year, and we just came out.

I'm Brady Connor, and on this recording you'll hear from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas.  \\nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found at the start of the earnings presentation posted on our Investor Relations website.  \\nInformation in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website.  \\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  \\nDiscussions and comments related to our 2025 guidance exclude any assumptions regarding the potential effects of the tariff environment, owing to the uncertain and evolving nature of these impacts.  \\nMaterials related to this discussion were posted this morning to our Investor Relations website. Additionally, we hope you'll join the webcast of our discussion of the earnings results and business updates that starts at 8:30am Eastern time today, April 22nd.  \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nWe had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter with continued execution of our longterm strategy. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our business and our strategic advantage as a full-service connectivity provider, driving financial growth despite changing market conditions.  \\nWe delivered strong financial growth across all our key financial metrics in the first quarter.  \\nWireless Service Revenue of 20.8 billion dollars was up 2.7 percent year over year, at the high end of our guided range.  \\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 4% to 12.6 billion dollars. This is our best reported quarterly EBITDA ever, with the highest growth rate in nearly four years.  \\nLastly, we delivered strong free cash flow of 3.6 billion dollars, up over 900 million dollars year-overyear, enabling continued execution of our capital allocation priorities.  \\nOur financial strength is notable considering the dynamic environment, marked by broad macro uncertainties, market volatility, and an evolving global trade landscape. We exited the quarter with positive sales momentum that has continued into April, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance.  \\nWe are actively monitoring the tariff developments and working closely with our strategic suppliers to effectively manage the potential impacts for our customers and shareholders, as we successfully did during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, our diverse portfolio of offerings serves all segments of the market and position us for success in any economic environment.  \\nLet me highlight some of the strategic moves we've made during the last 12 months that improve our ability to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth while improving the customer experience.  \\nAs part of our Consumer transformation, we recently introduced a 3-year price lock and free phone guarantee for new and existing customers on myPlan. We also launched My Biz Plan, which extends the same control, value and simplicity to our small and medium-sized business customers. Our dedication to improving customer experience is reflected in our ongoing development of customerfirst offerings and our brand refresh.  \\nWe accelerated our broadband expansion plans by increasing our organic build pace and through the pending acquisition of Frontier.  \\nAnd we announced our AI Connect offerings to enable AI at scale and open up new revenue streams, and executed on satellite partnerships that enable texting anywhere, for free.  \\nOur network continues to be a key differentiator.  The C-band deployment remains ahead of plan and on track to cover 80 to 90 percent of our planned sites by year end. We are aggressively rolling out 5G Advanced features and making the best 5G network even better. We are also tracking ahead of our FiOS build plans and are on track to deliver 650 thousand incremental passings this year. Our multi-dwelling unit solution for fixed wireless access was recently launched in more than 15 markets, and is expected to gradually ramp up over time. Lastly, we once again earned the top spot in the industry, claiming Best 5G, Fastest 5G, and Most Reliable 5G in the 2024 RootMetrics second half drive tests.  \\nShifting to operational performance, the breadth of our product portfolio, which covers all market segments, delivered year-over-year improvement in our combined postpaid and prepaid phone net adds.  We had a slow start on postpaid phone net adds, largely driven by elevated churn in Consumer from our recent pricing actions, and pressure from federal government accounts. We continue to execute on our multi-year business transformation effort in Consumer, and remain confident to deliver full-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds. Our prepaid net adds of 137 thousand were the best since the TracFone acquisition and represent a significant year-over-year improvement. Our prepaid brands play a critical role in our segmented-market strategy to ensure we have targeted offerings for all customers.  \\nIn Broadband, we continued to take share and grew our subscriber base with our dual Fixed Wireless Access and fiber strategy, adding 339 thousand subscribers in the quarter. With Fixed Wireless Access and fiber, we have the most complete offering, covering all segments of the market, and we will cover more than 100 million premises over time. Our Fixed Wireless Access product continues to lead the broadband growth and we have great momentum to reach our next milestone 8 to 9 million Fixed Wireless Access subscribers by 2028. We are excited to expand our broadband opportunity and continue to scale upon closing of our pending Frontier acquisition.  \\nAnd our private networks business continues to scale. We closed more than a dozen deals in the quarter, including private networks for AdventHealth and Nucor.  \\nWe were named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed IoT Connectivity Services worldwide, and reached an agreement to deliver a turnkey IoT solution for Atlanta Hawks.  \\nOn AI Connect, that we presented earlier in the year, we have seen accelerated interest and continue to expand our partner ecosystem. We have added hundreds of new opportunities to our funnel in the first quarter, including some very well-known brands, and seeing particular interest in our dark fiber and wave services.  \\nLooking ahead, we are confident in our strategy to drive sustainable subscriber and financial growth.  \\nOur innovative customer-first offerings along with the continuous improvement in our overall mobility performance position us to grow our subscriber base as we progress through the year.  \\nOur growth areas such as broadband, private networks, and AI Connect are scaling rapidly and are unlocking new revenue streams using our existing assets.  \\nFinally, our financial discipline is enabling successful execution of our capital allocation priorities: investing in the business for growth, supporting and growing our dividend, paying down our debt, and eventually executing on share repurchase.  \\nDuring periods of elevated uncertainty, our business has demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience, when our differentiators and structural advantages become even more apparent, helping to protect our business and create durability in our financial performance. And with our bias for action and our position of strength, we expect that we will not only weather the current environment, but we will thrive in it.  \\nNow, I'll turn to Tony to discuss our results in greater detail.  \\nAnthony Skiadas Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer  \\nThanks, Hans, and good morning.  \\nThis quarter proved once again that our business is resilient. We provide essential products and remain confident in our full-year guidance.  \\nThe first quarter demonstrated our ability to drive strong financial results.  We delivered Wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of our guided range and our highest quarter of year over year Adjusted EBITDA growth in almost four years.  \\nOur customer segmentation strategy is working. This, together with strong execution, led to an improved combined postpaid and Core prepaid phone net add performance from last year. We achieved this even with challenges in the federal government accounts and churn pressure in Consumer postpaid.  \\nThis pressure caused consumer postpaid phone churn to rise by 7 basis points in the first quarter relative to last year. The increase is largely due to multiple pricing actions that were implemented over the past few months. The collective pricing changes are anticipated to yield over 1 billion dollars in incremental service revenue, allowing for greater operating flexibility for the rest of the year.  \\nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 356 thousand for the first quarter, compared to 194 thousand net losses in the prior year period.  \\nWe exited the first quarter with positive momentum.  Consumer postpaid phone gross adds in March were up mid-single digits from the prior year and the performance in April continues to be strong.  \\nWe're encouraged by the operational trends we're seeing, and are focused on driving mobility volume growth for the full year. Our 3 Year Price Lock and Free Phone Guarantee is the next phase of our  \\nConsumer transformation. This new offering was contemplated in our 2025 guidance and provides another example of our ability to innovate within the myPlan platform.  \\nTurning to upgrades, the Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 3.0 percent in the first quarter, slightly lower than the prior year. We continue to see customers holding onto their phones for longer periods of time. For the full year, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by mid-single digits from 2024, reflecting an anticipated increase in volumes throughout the balance of the year.  \\nOur offers are resonating in the market. We remain confident that, for the full year 2025, we will deliver year-over-year improvement in Consumer postpaid phone net adds while maintaining our financial discipline.  \\nVerizon Business delivered 67 thousand phone net adds, down from 80 thousand net adds in the prior year period. We continue to evolve our offerings to provide businesses with the network solutions they need.   We recently launched My Biz Plan - a new, innovative plan structure that will better serve small and medium businesses with additional choice, value, and flexibility. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment, delivering strong volumes for the full year 2025.  \\nNow, let me turn to our Core prepaid results where the improved performance more than offset the year-over-year change in total postpaid phone net adds.  \\nCore Prepaid net additions were 137 thousand for the quarter, an improvement of 268 thousand from the prior year. Our strong execution and strategy to invest in the Straight Talk, Visible, and Total Wireless brands continues to pay off.  All three brands are producing strong volume growth, helping us build a high-quality customer base.  \\nMoving on to broadband, we delivered 339 thousand net additions in the quarter. We are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless access offerings.  \\nIn fixed wireless access, we're off to a good start to the year and remain on-track for our 8 to 9 million FWA subscriber target by 2028. We delivered 308 thousand net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 4.8 million subscribers. We see increased opportunity for expansion ahead as we further deploy our C-Band in more suburban and rural areas.  \\nFios internet net adds for the first quarter were 45 thousand versus 53 thousand in the prior year period. Fios continues to be a best-in-class broadband solution, with high levels of customer satisfaction, demonstrated by strong ARPU and continued low levels of churn. We're bringing Fios to more and more communities and are on-track to reach 650 thousand new passings this year.  \\nThe team is also working through the necessary steps to close the pending Frontier acquisition. We continue to expect the deal to close in early 2026. We have received regulatory approvals from several states and are continuing to work with federal and state-level agencies. We are also working through integration planning efforts to ensure a smooth transition upon deal closing. Frontier plays an important role in Verizon's broadband strategy, and we are excited about expanding our fiber footprint and accelerating our broadband growth opportunities.  \\nLooking at our financials, we had a very strong first quarter and maintain a high level of confidence in reaching our financial targets for 2025.  \\nTotal wireless service revenue was 20.8 billion dollars in the first quarter, up 2.7 percent year-overyear. We have taken several actions that have positioned us well for achieving service revenue growth throughout the year.  \\nConsumer ARPA of $146.46 in the first quarter represented an increase of 3.6 percent year-overyear. This was primarily driven by pricing actions implemented over the past year.  \\nAdditionally, the increased adoption of perks and growth in fixed wireless access subscribers continue to drive ARPA.  \\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 12.6 billion dollars, which is the highest we've ever reported and an increase of 4.0 percent compared to the prior year period. The growth was fueled by wireless service revenue coupled with the benefits from cost-saving initiatives.  \\nFrom a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete and we are already realizing run rate savings, which will provide a benefit for the full year. We continue to execute on cost efficiency initiatives to further improve the financial profile of the business. Adjusted EPS was $1.19 in the quarter, up 3.5 percent year over year, primarily due to the strength in Adjusted EBITDA.  \\nTurning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $7.8 billion, an increase of nearly 700 million dollars over the prior year.  The year over year growth in CFFO was primarily driven by the growth in adjusted EBITDA.  \\nCapEx for the quarter came in at 4.1 billion dollars compared to $4.4 billion dollars in the prior year. Consistent with prior years, we expect the pace of capital expenditures to ramp as we get further into the year. We continue to find efficiencies with our C-Band deployment and Fios build out, allowing us to efficiently deliver more solutions within our capital envelope.  \\nFree cash flow was $3.6 billion dollars in the first quarter, up over 900 million dollars, or more than 34 percent, from the prior year.  \\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $115.1 billion dollars, an $11.0 billion dollar improvement year-over-year. This was higher by $1.4 billion dollars sequentially primarily due to non cash mark to market adjustments. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.3 times improvement year over year and in-line with the prior quarter.  \\nOur balance sheet continues to be a key strength of our business. Of note, we have less than 700 million dollars in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. This provides us with a clear pathway for meaningful debt reduction ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction, in alignment with our capital allocation strategy.  \\nIn summary, we are pleased with the financial performance of the business in the first quarter. We delivered strong wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, as well as Free Cash Flow growth.  \\nWe continue to deliver more value to our customers, including our recently launched 3 Year Price Lock and Free Phone Guarantee. The actions we've taken to improve our postpaid phone trends are starting to bear fruit.  \\nCore Prepaid is continuing to perform well and our Broadband base continues to grow.  \\nWe have a recurring business that will remain resilient. Our strong financial results in the first quarter put Verizon in a position of strength to deliver better financial and customer growth in 2025.  \\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you, Tony.  \\nI am proud of our team's performance in this first quarter. We remain focused on our three key financial metrics: growing Wireless Service Revenue, and expanding Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.  \\nWe look forward to sharing more about how we offer more value to our customers and continue to drive both financial and subscriber growth on our 8:30 AM call this morning.\"),\n",

It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance.

Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses.

Our performance in the first half of the year highlighted by  a  strong  second  quarter  demonstrate  that  our  strategy  is  working.  We  remain  committed  to  disciplined  execution  and  customer-centric innovation. We're growing profitable connections and the value of our customer relationships. While we always see opportunities to improve, I'm confident in the future of our business.  \\nOur financial performance was strong this quarter, with a market-leading wireless service revenue of $20.9 billion, up 2.2% from last year. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year, setting another record for the best reported quarter and the second consecutive quarter with growth exceeding our guided range for the year.  \\nStrong profitability drove free cash flow of $5.2 billion for the quarter. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $8.8 billion, an increase of over $300 million compared to the first half of 2024. Our cash flow from operation underscores the strength of our business and provide us flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.  \\nAs a result, we continue to lead in the industry with the nation's best network. Our segmented market strategy, which is a diverse portfolio of offerings is resonating with our customers. Our customer-first offering, such as MyPlan, MyHome and the new My Biz Plan, along with our Best Value Guarantee drove significant sales momentum.  \\nWe're also deploying AI-powered innovations to enhance the customer experience on the nation's best network. On the infrastructure front, our execution is outpacing our targets. C-band deployment is ahead of schedule. Our fixed wireless base has surpassed 5 million subscribers, and our fiber build is tracking ahead of its plan. This demonstrates disciplined execution across our entire portfolio.  \\nGiven our financial performance and the momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We're also raising our guidance for free cash flow for the year, driven by our strong cash flow from operations and further supported by the positive impact from the tax reform. Tony will provide you with more details shortly.  \\nNow, let's turn to our operational performance. In the second quarter, we delivered over 300,000 net additions across our mobility and broadband platforms. In mobility, we delivered year-over-year improvements in the combined postpaid and core prepaid phone net adds, including the fourth consecutive quarter of subscriber growth in core prepaid.  \\nThe wireless market remains competitive, and we continue to take a strategic and segmented approach, maintaining our financial discipline. As expected, postpaid phone churn remained elevated this quarter, reflecting the lingering effects of our pricing actions and ongoing pressure from federal government accounts.  \\nWe're actively focused on improving retention by strengthening our value propositions and leveraging our AI-powered customer experience innovations. On upgrades after being down year-over-year for eight out of the last nine quarters, we saw an uptick in the second quarter, driven by our Best Value Guarantee.  \\nWe continue to expect mid single-digit growth in upgrade activity for the full year. Our dual Fixed Wireless Access and fiber broadband strategy continues to drive market share gains. A key highlight is Fixed Wireless Access, which surpassed the 5 million subscribers milestone, keeping us firmly on the track to achieve our goal of 8 million to 9 million subscribers by 2028.  \\nWe achieved robust broadband growth even as our C-band build-out expands into less dense markets and despite a softer move environment in our Fios footprint. We continue to scale our private network business winning a landmark deal to deploy multiple private 5G networks across the Thames Freeport. This network will serve as a technology foundation for one of UK's busiest commercial corridors, fueling a multibillion-dollar regeneration project with advanced capabilities like AI and real-time logistics.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"),\n",

Our sales funnel has nearly doubled to $2 billion since launch earlier the year. While these are often complex deals with longer sales cycles, we're actively engaged in several sizable opportunities.  \\nThis growth highlights the surging demand for high-bandwidth fiber capacity and diverse routes both lit and dark fiber to serve different customer needs. As AI transitions from centralized training to widespread real-time applications, compute power at the network edge becomes essential. Our existing infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support this evolution.  \\nOur network is our key differentiator, consistently delivering top performance. This quarter, J.D. Power once again recognized Verizon for the best network quality and RootMetrics first half year 2025 awards named us the nation's best, fastest, and most reliable 5G network. We're building on this advantage every day.  \\nOur C-band deployment is ahead of schedule and on track to cover 80% to 90% of planned sites by year-end, with nearly all sites now standalone capable. Our fiber build is tracking ahead of plan, and we're positioned to deliver 650,000 incremental passings this year.  \\nMeanwhile, the regulatory approval process for our pending acquisition of Frontier is progressing as planned. We're encouraged by Frontier's performance and look forward to closing the transaction to further accelerate our fiber expansion.  \\nAs we near the closing of Frontier acquisition, we will provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, broadband expansion and capital allocation considering all stakeholders. We look forward to providing an update in the next few months.  \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tony to go into the financials in more detail.\"),\n",

The first half of the year reaffirms the strength of our business, highlighting the effective execution of our disciplined strategy and significant progress towards achieving our financial goals.

The second quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong financial results even in a period of elevated promotional activity and broad economic uncertainty.  \\nWe remain focused on high-quality, profitable growth, recognizing that volume growth is only valuable when aligned with our disciplined financial framework. Our goal is to improve volumes year-over-year, but we will not do this at the expense of delivering on our three key financial priorities.  \\nThis past quarter, we achieved strong sales focusing on high-quality customers without overspending for growth. Even with Public Sector challenges and ongoing Consumer postpaid phone churn pressure, we maintained our financial discipline.  \\nWithin Consumer, second quarter postpaid phone gross additions were up sequentially and year-over-year. Our sales execution remains strong, leveraging our attractive value proposition, including the recent launch of the Best Value Guarantee.  \\nAs expected, we saw the residual effects of our first quarter pricing actions impact our second quarter Consumer postpaid phone churn. Additionally, we continue to see elevated competitor promotional activity. As a result, second quarter Consumer postpaid phone churn remained consistent with the first quarter at that 0.90%.  \\nWe have taken a series of actions to address our elevated churn. On June 24, we launched initiatives designed to improve the customer experience, including leveraging AI for more personalized support. In addition, we continue to enhance our value proposition and build customer loyalty through the Best Value Guarantee.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us'),\n",

Mobility phone net adds, which includes both consumer and business retail postpaid as well as core prepaid, were 16,000 for the second quarter. This represents an improvement of 25,000 from the prior year period.  \\nConsumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 51,000 for the second quarter compared to 109,000 net losses in the prior year period as we benefited from strong gross adds. Verizon Business delivered 42,000 phone net adds in the second quarter compared with 135,000 net adds in the prior year period.  \\nA significant majority of the year-over-year decline was driven by the Public Sector business. Though we anticipate Public Sector pressures to persist in the second half of the year, we expect the impact to subside towards the end of the year.  \\nConsistent with our wireline approach, we continue to remain disciplined and not pursue low-margin wireless business or overpay for volumes. We remain confident that the team has the tools to execute effectively in the current environment and deliver healthy volumes for the full year of 2025.  \\nCore prepaid net additions were 50,000 for the quarter an improvement of 62,000 from the prior year period. This marks four consecutive quarters of positive core prepaid net adds, reflecting the strong execution of the team. The Visible, Total Wireless and Straight Talk brands continue to perform well and are progressively building a high-quality business.  \\nOverall, core prepaid ARPU rose above $32 and we have now reached an inflection point where after four quarters of volume growth, we expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth for the remainder of the year.  \\nTurning to total wireless postpaid upgrades. We saw a 14% increase in the first half of the year as compared to the same period of 2024. This result was driven by a healthy initial uptake of our Best Value Guarantee program, which is an investment in our high-quality customer base. As Hans said earlier, we continue to expect upgrade activity to increase by a mid single-digit percentage in 2025 as compared to 2024.  \\nMoving on to broadband. We delivered 293,000 net additions in the quarter. We are taking broadband share and see strong demand for both our fiber and Fixed Wireless Access offerings, even with seasonal impacts and a softer move environment as compared to prior years.  \\nIn Fixed Wireless Access, we delivered 278,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to more than 5.1 million subscribers. FWA demand remains strong, and we are on track to deliver our goal of 8 million to 9 million FWA subscribers by 2028.  \\nFios internet net adds for the second quarter were 32,000 versus 28,000 in the prior year period. Fios provides customers with industry leading connectivity and delivers high customer satisfaction reflected in both robust ARPU and consistently low churn rates. We are expanding our Fios footprint and remain on track to deliver 650,000 new passings in 2025.  \\nAs we talk about fiber, let me provide a brief update on the pending Frontier transaction. The team is working through the necessary steps to complete the acquisition, and we remain on track for an early 2026 close. We have received regulatory approvals from eight states as well as the FCC and DOJ and are productively engaged with the remaining state regulatory agencies.  \\nBased on Frontier's publicly reported results, the company continues to perform extremely well and remains on track with their fiber expansion goals. Our integration planning efforts are well underway, and we anticipate a smooth transition upon the deal closing. We are looking forward to having Frontier's assets serve as an important catalyst for our fiber expansion and broadband growth acceleration.  \\nTurning to our financial results. We delivered another strong quarter. Second quarter consolidated revenue reached $34.5 billion, up 5.2% year over year. This result was driven by solid wireless service revenue and a more than 25% increase in wireless equipment revenue. Services and other revenue rose 1.6%. Total wireless service revenue reached $20.9 billion in the second quarter, a 2.2% increase year over year.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \\nGrowth was driven by consumer ARPA, which rose 2.3% year over year. We realized benefits from recent pricing actions, expansion of Fixed Wireless Access, and increased revenue from perks and other adjacent services. Our robust perk offerings continue to grow at a steady pace, keeping us on track to achieve our goal of 15 million perks by year end and providing a healthy contribution to service revenue.  \\nIn addition, prepaid revenue has reached a turning point and was flat in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. We expect prepaid to positively contribute to wireless service revenue growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we are well positioned for continued service revenue growth with healthy underlying customer economics.  \\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.8 billion which is the highest we have ever reported and an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year period. Wireless service revenue growth coupled with the benefits from cost savings initiatives more than offset the impact from the elevated upgrade activity.  \\nThrough the first half of 2025, both wireless service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are up nearly $1 billion from the prior year, reflecting strong operating leverage. Within that result, the Business segment EBITDA has now grown for three consecutive quarters on a year over year basis.  \\nFrom a cost perspective, our voluntary separation program is now complete, generating substantial savings. In addition, we're actively pursuing opportunities within our legacy businesses. These include copper decommissioning and savings from the managed services initiative within our business segment, among other cost efficiency programs. Adjusted EPS was $1.22 in the quarter, up 6.1% year over year, primarily due to the strength in Adjusted EBITDA.  \\nTurning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of the year was $16.8 billion, up more than 1% compared with the same period a year ago. CapEx for the first half of 2025 came in at $8 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year period. We continue to realize efficiencies in our C-band deployment and Fios expansion, enabling us to effectively meet or exceed our network goals well within our capital budget.  \\nFor the first half of the year, the net effect of Cash flow from operations and CapEx resulted in free cash flow of $8.8 billion, an increase of 3.6% compared to the same period a year ago. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $116 billion, a $6.9 billion improvement year over year. In the first half of the year, our debt reduction was offset by non-cash mark to market adjustments.  \\nOur net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of the quarter, a 0.2 times improvement year over year and in line with the prior quarter. We continue to make progress towards our long-term leverage target ahead of the closing of the Frontier transaction.  \\nOur balance sheet remains a significant strength of our organization. Notably, we have under $700 million in unsecured debt maturities remaining in 2025. We will continue to focus on reducing debt ahead of completing the Frontier transaction.  \\nAs Hans mentioned earlier, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will continue to strategically invest in the business, enhancing our mobile and broadband networks, support a healthy and growing dividend and paying down debt towards our long-term leverage target.  \\nAs we've mentioned previously, we'll consider buybacks once we reach our leveraged target. Our strong operational execution in the first half of the year coupled with favorable tax reform gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for the full year.  \\nGiven the strong Adjusted EBITDA performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year guidance to 2.5% to 3.5% growth, an increase of approximately $125 million at the midpoint.  \\nWe are increasing our guidance for Adjusted EPS growth to a range of 1% to 3% to reflect a new Adjusted EBITDA outlook.  \\nWe are raising our 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion. The increase is driven by an estimated benefit of $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the recently enacted tax legislation as well as the disciplined operational execution that drove our strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance in the first half of the year.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us  \\nOur wireless service revenue and CapEx guidance remains unchanged. As we get closer to the closing of the Frontier transaction, we expect to provide an update on our broadband plans as well as our capital allocation strategy.  \\nIn summary, we have a resilient business model with a high-quality customer base and continue to execute well on both mobility and broadband. Our second quarter financial performance reflects our disciplined approach to growth, and we are well positioned to deliver on our improved outlook in the second half of the year.  \\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Hans.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you, Tony. Our strong first half results reaffirm our confidence in Verizon's strategy. Our strategic execution and the ongoing momentum across our business underpin our decision to raise full year guidance. Our focus remains clear. We are committed to growing wireless service revenue, expanding Adjusted EBITDA and generating strong free cash flow.  \\nWe will achieve this through three key priorities. First, building on our network leadership to create compelling customer offerings that accelerate growth in our mobility and broadband businesses. Secondly, maintaining operational excellence and financial discipline across the organization.  \\nThirdly, scaling our next-generation platforms from capturing new enterprise opportunities with private networks to enabling AI at scale and unlocking new revenue streams from our existing assets.  \\nThe opportunities ahead are significant and the pending Frontier acquisition will accelerate our fiber strategy.  \\nVerizon's unique market position and the essential nature of our services are fundamental to empowering individuals, businesses and society. Verizon has the assets, the strategy, and most importantly, the team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunities ahead.  \\nWith that, Brady, it's time for Q&amp;A.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for questions.\"),\n",

Let me start with the capital allocation. I think your comments and question there is more than valid. As you saw, we raised our guidance for free cash flow, partly because of our cash flow from operation is improving, but also the tax reform that we indicated on how much it is.  \\nAs I said before, I mean, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. I mean it's, first of all, in our business, and we have increased the CapEx this year compared to 2024. The dividend, of course, 18 years of increase. We want to put the Board in a position to continue to grow. We paid down our debt. We paid down our debt again with almost $3 billion in the first half, and then it will be buybacks.  \\nNow, we are in a situation where we are getting closer to the expected (corrected by company after the call)next year closing of Frontier. So what I said in my prepared remarks is I want to get a holistic view on all the capital allocation. I mean how we're going to invest in fiber, what synergies we see, how we're going to do the capital allocation priorities.  \\nBut clearly, the tax reform is helping us to get faster to the priorities we have. So we feel good about that. But let me come back to that. So I think we can give you a holistic view on capital allocation. But clearly, we're very excited about Frontier. The performance is great. The synergies are great. And of course, the convergence and the fiber opportunities are also great. So very excited for that. And so far, Frontier has performed really good.  \\nOn the wireless consumer, I think that our ambition as was outlined by Sampath in the beginning of the year doing better this year is still valid. I mean there's no difference on that. However, we're going to continue to be very financially disciplined.  \\nFor us, we will not sacrifice our financials, but you're still getting net adds if it doesn't make sense. If it's too expensive. You saw us in the fourth quarter last year being aggressive because we saw the opportunities of creating and gaining a lot of high-quality customers.  \\nYou saw our gross adds in second quarter. So it all depends on where the market is and where we go, but ultimately, our goal is to increase our service revenue and then expand our Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. That's our main KPIs.  \\nAnd then on churn, Tony will probably chime in on all of this. But on churn, expected in the second quarter was elevated coming from the prices, but also from the competitive environment. I think the whole industry is up, Sampath put in a lot of very important churn measurements, 624. That now is working going through our system. All our AI-empowered customer service impacting.  \\nSo very encouraged about what the team is doing and how they are working on the loyalty and retention of our customers. So that's all. A little bit Tony will chime in on all three, I guess.  \\nAnthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \\nYeah. Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Ben. So a couple of things on churn. Obviously, we're focused on reducing churn in a financially disciplined manner. And as Hans mentioned, we have a great value proposition with the Verizon value guarantee and also My Biz on the business side.  \\nWe have further deployment of C-band. We said we're going to get to 80% to 90% of C-band this year deployed, and we see lower churn where C-band is deployed. And then the work that Hans mentioned on customer experience, we did a CX launch on June 24. And that work is also augmented by AI, and we expect to see improvements there. And then obviously, convergence will also reduce mobility churn. And the team has the retention tools to get there, and they're focused on it.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"),\n",

Can you just talk a little bit about the drivers that are causing that deceleration?  \\nAnd then a follow-up on one of the comments. The upgrade rates in the teens in the first half, do you expect mid-single digits for the year. What's the driver of the -- what would suggest to be a pretty rapid deceleration in the upgrades? Thanks.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you. On the postpaid ARPA, I think, again, I mean, we have been growing our ARPA for a long time, and we continue to. We have many levers in there all the way from our broadband by step-ups, only 50% of our customers on MyPlan. We had the adjacent services. You heard when we had our prepared remarks on our perks basically doubling this year, up to 15 million perks. So we have a lot of drivers for it. So we still believe that we have a good run rate on that.  \\nOn the upgrades, as you articulated, we have been down eight quarters of the last nine when it comes to upgrades for many reasons. This quarter, we put in, first of all, a couple of incentives for customers to upgrade. So that's why we saw a little bit higher. But remember, when we talk about the mid single digits, that both business and consumer. That's the total investment we're having in upgrades.  \\nAnthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President  \\nAnd then just a couple of other points on the upgrades. I mean, we absorbed the higher upgrades. The upgrades were up 30% year-over-year, and we still produced strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter.

Hey, Mike. So on the Adjusted EBITDA, we were up over $500 million in the quarter and about $1 billion of Adjusted EBITDA growth year-to-date, and that's also in light of having a pretty significant upgrade activity mostly driven by the launch of our Value Guarantee.  \\nAnd we stayed very disciplined in the quarter. We didn't chase volumes. And they gave us the confidence that resiliency in the business gave us the confidence to raise the guide. And it starts with the top line revenue and wireless service revenue is up 2.4% year-to-date. So we're seeing great operating leverage, as Hans mentioned.  \\nAnd there's a lot of work going on the cost side of the house to continue to make the business a lot more efficient in serving customers day in and day out. If you think about the customer care and the work we launched on June 24, that includes having AI enabled customer care, managed services.  \\nWe're seeing great progress now with the managed services work that Kyle and the team are doing, and we're seeing good savings here ramping up in 2025. The network team continues to take out cost and legacy network elements that includes copper decommissioning and that work is ongoing.  \\nAnd then even in Business Wireline, we continue to de-emphasize low-margin deals and stay very disciplined there. And then from a headcount standpoint, the voluntary separation program is now behind us, and we're seeing a full run rate benefit for the balance of the year.  \\nSo there's really no assumption changes in upgrades, as you asked before. We said mid single-digits for the full year. That still stays intact. And what we've said is volumes are important, but we're going to stay disciplined in our approach and in support of the three measures that Hans mentioned wireless service revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"),\n",

First of all, Sampath and the team together with our CMO, Leslie, have been working really hard to segment up our market because as we see the market having less and less new customers come into the market, a segmented approach becomes important.

All of them have different brand attributes and appealing to different segmentations.  \\nSo this is sort of a segmented growth strategy we have in wireless for Consumer, and that will continue. And you just refine and see that we have the right offerings in all the different type of brands we have. I would say some of the brands are doing extraordinary well. I mean, Total Wireless, Visible, very good, very targeted. Some of them have some sort of promotions. Some of them are just having a service fee.  \\nSo it's very different, and you're going to see us continue doing that work because that is part of our growth story that we can actually meet any consumer with different economical background with the service.

I want to follow-up to Ben's first question where you talked about capital allocation. Under the new budget or the One Big, Beautiful Bill, there is an expectation of significant spectrum sales, even though the spectrum hasn't been identified, can you just talk a little bit about that as to how you would prioritize spectrum purchases. If there's either a government action or alternatively if private market spectrum comes available from EchoStar as to how that might affect, for example, your discussion about possible share buybacks.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nThank you. When it comes to spectrum, I mean, I think that what we are -- we're sitting on a really good position on spectrum and with a C-band, millimeter wave, or a low band, and that's what you see we are deploying right now. So we feel good about where we are with spectrum.  \\nThen I've said all the time that the US over time needs more spectrum, especially as 6G comes up, et cetera, in order to stay competitive and being the most digitalized country in the world. So we're, of course, thinking is good. That's part of the bill. But as you rightfully said, it still needs to be freeing up spectrum and all of that, and that will take some time.  \\nWhen it comes to in general capital allocation of spectrum, we always do the build versus buy. I mean, we have done it way before I joined. We look into will this -- buy the spectrum being better than building our own spectrum today. That's the comparison of what it's going to do when we see spectrum in the market.\"),\n",

On the gross adds, a couple of things here. The strength came from two places. First, we had very strong sales execution in our stores and distribution. The team did a great job. And then secondly, the value proposition when you think about -- we launched the Best Value Guarantee back at the beginning of April, and that is resonating with customers in the market.  \\nAnd we see a healthy mix of new to Verizon in the quarter, and we're also writing good business as well. And what we said many times is volumes are important, and we'll pulse in and pulse out where it makes financial sense. And then as we said earlier, the biggest opportunity for us is loyalty and retention, and the team is focused on it.  \\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  \\nYeah. And if we talk about what was launch 624, I think that it was a lot of AI supported customer experience tools we put in. I mean, first of all, when it comes to the process, we now will have a customer care employee following a request or a complaint from our customers all the way. So we actually finish it out with the same person starting and ending and also having uptake. That was a concern for our customers that we heard through the year and that we needed to improve.  \\nThe other thing is we're also opening up for our customer service 24/7, very important. Again, that was a feedback that people are having different work hours. They want to call different times. We're going to fix that. And then, of course, we're giving our customer care employees an AI tool so they can treat our customer better and know their problems better because this could be stressful. We know that having the connectivity is such an essential service mobility in broadband.  \\nAnd then the last thing, we're going to leverage even more our stores. I mean, 93% of the US population has less than 30 minutes of Verizon store. We're going to leverage that more, see that's going to be a place where you can get more support and help as well. So we leverage all the assets and all our employees to see that we're treating our customers better.  \\nAnd I think it's an area we can excel in, and then we basically have worked a lot on our product side, where we have MyPlan, My Biz, MyHome, all of that with perks, which is really resonating. We have worked on a brand that we refreshed the brand last year, and that is actually going really good as well. And the network is, of course, the best network in the market that once again was proven by J.D. Power and RootMetrics.  \\nSo we're working on all the cylinders how we compete for any type of customer all the way from enterprise government, small and medium to prepaid, postpaid customers, and broadband and mobility. So it's a holistic thinking how we're going to do this. Thank you for the question.  \\nBrady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations  \\nThanks, Greg.

Yeah. There are some slight changes to the BEAD program rules, which opened up some opportunities for us, of course, and then it's a process of rebuilding. I think that's one area. The other areas, of course, we have been building since the first BEAD opportunity came up.  \\nSo the combination of this is probably that we have the same opportunities as we had when the BEAD program started. We're going to BEAD where we see that we have a good return and with some subsidies from the government. So no major change for us. We are in this process right now. So I need to come back to you when we see the outcome of that rebuilding.\"),\n",

Yeah, it's a lot going on there. I mean, some of you have been following us for quite a while. You know that somewhere in '23, our performance was not the best. We took a lot of decisions, including getting basically a new management team. Since then, we have been aligning on what we need to do, and you see so many vectors of growth that we didn't have before. I mean, all the way from fiber, Fixed Wireless Access and of course the fiber will be added in the Frontier over time.  \\nYou see our AI Connect that we talk about on the business side so that we can leverage our assets on the on the fixed side. We have the adjacent services that for a couple of years ago were very small. Now, with the perks and all of that we're doubling the growth there.  \\nSo we have the convergence coming up as well. We have prepaid that Tony talked about that was zero or negative for us for quite a while. Now, we're basically flattish and of course, expecting that the team is going to. And then we have all the step up and the segmented growth that I talked about.  \\nSo the team is executed really good and, in the foundation, we have a great network that we now are sort of capturing all the opportunities we receive an investment we did for a couple of years ago, and that's what you see. And then on top of that with the discipline from Tony and the team, we're taking out cost and then you see the leverage and sometimes we just underestimate what great business this is.  \\nI mean, it's an enormous business when it comes to revenue and subscriber-based services and the generation of cash is extraordinary. We will just continue to drive that and see that we have the right offerings for our customer, but that's what's behind it. We're really well executed and what you should expect from Verizon, which is our trademark.\"),\n",

The team continues to grow volumes, both mobility and FWA and the business continues to skew more wireless, which is great to see, and we said the goal was to improve the EBITDA profile in this segment, and we saw really good progress in the first half of the year.  \\nWe have three straight quarters now of growth. So if you look at between the revenue and the margins on the revenue side, as I said, more wireless FWA and mobility growing even though we're growing through even the Public Sector pressures as well. And we're also seeing contributions from private 5G networks and AI Connect, and that's also offsetting some of the wireline decline that we see.  \\nAnd then on the cost side, Kyle and the team are doing a great job with our managed services transformation, the deal we signed with HCL is providing a lot of benefits this year and a lot of good discipline in terms of moving customers off of legacy progress -- products rather, and  \\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\"),\n",
